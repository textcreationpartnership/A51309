            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEing firmly aſſured in my own Reaſon and Judgment of the truth of my <hi>Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the Viſions of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> especially for the main; that the aſſurance of this Truth might alſo appear to others, I was deſirous that thoſe who have a Genius to theſe ſtudies, ſhould freely and diligently ſearch and examine theſe <hi>Expoſitions</hi> if they could find any flaw in them. And how unexceptionable they are, may appear from the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>S. E.</hi> the <hi>Remarker,</hi> to any unprejudiced Peruſer of the <hi>Anſwer</hi> and <hi>Remarks.</hi> But theſe were but from one hand. But in this preſent Treatiſe which I call <hi>Paralipomena Prophetica,</hi> there are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to Objections from more and more skilful hands, than that of the <hi>Remarker,</hi> who have exerciſed their Wits in objecting what they could. Whereby he that has a Genius and leiſure to peruſe what is written, I hope, will diſcover how ſound, ſolid and unexceptionable my <hi>Expoſitions</hi> are throughout.</p>
            <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:34043:4"/>
            <p>Concerning the Acceptance whereof in the World I ſhould not have the tenth part of this ſolicitude, were I not as fully perſwaded of the weighty <hi>Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the Expoſitions, as I am of the <hi>Truth</hi> of them. For it being ſo incredible a thing, ſince the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as well of <hi>Daniel</hi> as the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> (which were written and recorded for the uſe of the Church) do reach, the former higher, the other from the beginning of the Church to the End of the World, that they ſhould omit the Prefiguring of that great Degeneracy which would come into the Church, thoſe coarſe Corruptions in Doctrine and Worſhip and bloody Perſecutions of them that could not ſubmit to them; And being the Viſions are ſo eaſily interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that way, nor any cunningly diſtorted Gloſſes able to hide their genuine ſenſe from him that has but half an eye to diſcern what is true; And this grand Truth being, as too often others are, abuſed to popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Faction and Tumult, to Diſſentions and Schiſms even in the Reformed Churches themſelves, ſome brooding in their Fanatical minds vain conceits of a Riſing of the Witneſſes to come, whenas that Viſion moſt certainly has had its accompliſhment many years ago, and joining with the ruine of Antichriſt, the aboliſhing of Monarchy, if not of all Political Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and interpreting groſly thoſe Victories which the true Apoſtolick Church is to have againſt
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:34043:4"/>the Man of Sin (who is to be deſtroy'd by the breath of Chriſt's mouth and the Sword of the Spirit) as to be obtained by an arm of fleſh and moſt fierce and ſalvage Wars and Bloodſhed; And that they may thereby avoid that noble Teſtimony to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation (especially to this of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is ſo exquiſitely and profeſſedly reformed according to the Pattern of the Primitive Times while the Church remained <hi>Symmetral</hi>) they mint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo falſe Gloſſes touching the meaſuring of the Temple, <hi>Apoc. 11.</hi> and pretending the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are not yet <hi>riſen,</hi> nor will be till ſuch a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come as will fit their unaccountable Humours; I ſay therefore, my <hi>Expoſition</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> being ſo diametrically oppoſite to this Enthuſiaſtick Phrenſie, and I being not only aſſured of the <hi>Truth,</hi> but of this apparent <hi>Uſefulneſs</hi> thereof, for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace of Chriſtendom, for <hi>Loyalty</hi> to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, whether they be of the <hi>Reformed</hi> or <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed</hi> Religion, for ſecuring to Monarchs their Crowns, for the preventing barbarous Bloodſhed in the Chriſtian World, and for the extinguiſhing Sects and Schiſms, especially here in our own Nation, I thought I could not be over-diligent in evidencing the truth of my <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> and in publiſhing my NOTES at the ſame time with my <hi>Paralipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena Prophetica,</hi> they ſerving to both theſe and
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:34043:5"/>other weighty Purpoſes which I have mentioned in my <hi>Prefaces</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Expoſitions.</hi> Where, in that to the Viſions of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Sect. <hi>36, 37, 38.</hi> I have ſet down a lively Deſcription of the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian</hi> Spirit, which is the only Weapon whereby the Reformed Churches will be able to run down their Adverſaries, and the Conqueſt and Victory of ſuch will prove even the Joy and Advantage of them that are vanquiſhed and overcome. So little harm can come to the Chriſtian World, or indeed Univerſal Mankind, from the right underſtanding of thoſe admirable Records of Providence, <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what a peculiar aptneſs and efficacy it has to reconcile the Sectaries to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to ſhame them for ſeparating from ſo Authentick a Conſtitution to follow the Guidance of <hi>private</hi> Spirits; I cannot better expreſs it than I have already done in my <hi>Advertiſement</hi> on <hi>Joſ. Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> his Letter to my ſelf, printed with the laſt Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Saduciſmus Triumphatus.</hi> It is upon the occaſion of his Converſe with a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had followed all the ſorts of theſe <hi>Private-Spirit-Guides,</hi> which at laſt plunged him into down-right Atheiſm. The Harangue is ſomething long, but I hope not of ſo lazie a ſtrain but it will keep the Reader attentive, eſpecially it being ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſeaſonable.</p>
            <pb n="v" facs="tcp:34043:5"/>
            <p>To forſake the ſentiments of the ancient Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church (for ſuch are the Reformed Churches freed from the filth of the predicted Apoſtaſie, and ſuch in a ſpecial manner is the Church of <hi>England</hi>) to follow any private Spirit, is ſuch a piece of Folly and Giddineſs, that the Extravagance thereof is above expreſſion, and the danger ſo obvious, that they muſt be very blind and ſtupid that diſcern it not at firſt ſight. All are not born to be Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers or Theologers, and to have a faculty to decide Controverſies by the edge of their own Wit and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Wherefore it is both their duty and ſafety to adhere to the ſenſe of the Church Catholick before the Apoſtaſie, ſuch as it was for about four hundred years after Chriſt. Within which time the Divinity of Chriſt and Triunity of the Godhead was profeſſed as publick Articles of the Church, and the diſtinction of Biſhops and Presbyters owned. Whence it is demonſtrable how innocent the one is, and how Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox the other. For if the Articles of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt and Triunity of the Godhead were falſe, they had alſo been Idolatrous, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie had begun much ſooner than it is predicted to begin in that admirable Book of Prophecies the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> Nor was the late Reformation, which yet certainly it is (and I have undeniably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated it in the ſecond Part of the Appendage to
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:34043:6"/>my <hi>Expoſition</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Viſions) the Riſing of the Witneſſes. For they had been ſtrange Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that ſhould ſtill profeſs the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Triunity</hi> of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> if thoſe Articles were falſe, ſince it neceſſarily follows, that they were <hi>ipſo facto</hi> groſly Idolatrous; or retained <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> if it had been <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi> Theſe things are ſo exceeding plain, that no man can deny them, that has parts and leiſure, and without prejudice conſiders them. And if the Sectaries that pretend ſo much to the Spirit above others, had the Spirit of interpreting and underſtanding Prophecies aright, it would convince them of their <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Schiſm.</hi> But if this ſlowly goes down with them, they are to examine themſelves if it be not an humour with them to deny any ſuch <hi>Symmetral</hi> Times of the Church for about four hundred years, that they may ſtill find matter for eternal Cavils and Schiſms.</p>
            <p>But now the main Articles of our Faith being thus redoubtedly aſſured to us both from the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricalneſs</hi> of the Primitive Times for about four hundred years and the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of the <hi>Riſen Witneſſes,</hi> of which Political Reſurrection neither <hi>Quaker, Familiſt,</hi> nor <hi>Socinian</hi> partook of, as appears by the <hi>Harmony of Confeſſions</hi> of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, no Reformed Church own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Opinions; how juſt, how ſober and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:34043:6"/>a thing is it for every private man to adhere to this common Faith touching theſe main Articles, and not to commit himſelf to theſe <hi>Ignes Fatui</hi> of private Spirits, which may lead him ſo about as at laſt to plunge him into the Dregs of Atheiſm, as it happened to the above-mentioned Gentleman.</p>
            <p>That Spirit which leads from the Communion of the ancient Apoſtolick Church (which is a Light ſet upon an Hill, and ſo certainly to be known by thoſe Characters above-named) and carries men into the dark Holes of Schiſmatical Conventicles, is moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, let them pretend to what they will, the Spirit of Errour and Deluſion of the Devil, and a certain Symptom, that ſuch men are <hi>carnal,</hi> as highly as they think of themſelves, <hi>having not the Spirit;</hi> moſt aſſuredly having not the Spirit in that meaſure, whereby they become ſuch <hi>living</hi> Members of the true Catholick Church, which is the Body of Chriſt, that they plainly feel what hurts it, at leaſt what palpably ſtops its growth, what wounds it, what hazards the very life and being of it. Can they pretend to the Spirit of Chriſt in any due meaſure that are devoid of this neceſſary <hi>Sympathy</hi> and ſenſe of the common good of his Body and the Intereſt of his Kingdom, which is <hi>Reformed</hi> Chriſtendom? The Enemies whereof what do they deſire? What do they endeavour more than to divide and ſubdivide us?
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:34043:7"/>to hurry us into Opinions and Practices as unlike the ancient and Apoſtolick Church as may be, to make us appear as whimſical and ungovernable as they can, thereby to expoſe us to contempt and loathing, and to harden the hearts of the Princes and Prelates of Chriſtendom againſt a juſt <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> and thoſe that have reformed to make them ſick and weary of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the unſetledneſs and diſtraction of the people. Does the Spirit of Chriſt then lead to the deſtroying and laying waſte his own Church and Kingdom? Certainly that Spirit that hinders the growth, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards the being of the Kingdom of Chriſt, muſt be, not the Spirit of God, but the Spirit of Giddineſs, of Errour and of Deluſion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the ancient Authority of the Church, while it was <hi>Symmetral,</hi> is to be acknowledged, and thoſe main Points touching Faith and Worſhip to be adhered to and profeſſed, the Holy Ghoſt having ſet his Seal thereto in thoſe Divine Prophecies of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> and this deteſtable Pride and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Ingratitude (whenas yet things are ſo well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by lawful Authority in the late Riſing of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes) in thus breaking from ſo Authentick a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and ſetting up Schiſmatical Congregations, is heartily to be repented of; nor are we any longer to be deluded by that falſe Spirit, that under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:34043:7"/>of bringing in a <hi>more pure and ſpiritual</hi> Dispenſation, undermines and hazards the very Being of the true Kingdom of Chriſt by this odious ſpectacle of multifarious <hi>Schiſms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not the breath of any mere Man that can convey the Spirit of God to us, and it is a falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of thoſe high-flown <hi>Spiritualiſts,</hi> that think in their Schiſmatical Worſhip they have nearer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God than thoſe that adhere to the way of the ancient Apoſtolick Faith and Practice. For they in their Meetings are but <hi>taught</hi> by <hi>men,</hi> and thoſe speaking the ſenſe of a <hi>private</hi> Spirit, they being Straglers from the Fold of Chriſt, as having bid adieu to the ancient Catholick and Apoſtolick Church; of which yet the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which they have forſaken, is a genuine part, and therefore its Miniſtry more <hi>ſafe</hi> and <hi>Autoritative,</hi> they ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe of the ancient Apoſtolick Church, not any blind Conceits and Phancies of their own. And for the ſaving <hi>Operations</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> nothing is more inculcated than that in our <hi>Publick Service.</hi> Nor is the Miniſtry of man ſo much the conveyer of it, as the ſincerity of the Party who deſires to partake of it. It is the gift of Chriſt to the ſincere, who has told us from his own mouth here upon Earth, <hi>That bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="x" facs="tcp:34043:8"/>
            <p>It is not the hearing of a <hi>gracious</hi> man once or twice a week, or being preſent ſometimes in the Meetings, whether <hi>ſilent</hi> or <hi>vocal,</hi> of a Company of ſullen Melancholiſts or Hiſtrionical <hi>Mock-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> but a firm and unſhaken Faith in the power of the promiſed Spirit of Chriſt for the ſubduing our Corruptions, a fixt and continued Reſolution of not offending the God of Heaven in any thing, ſmall or great, a cloſe Guard upon our Words and Actions, as having a ſenſe of the Preſence of the Divine Majeſty all the day long, a perpetual exerciſe of mortifying the impetuoſities of our own Will, and of extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the <hi>ſweet</hi> Reliſhes of <hi>Self-intereſt</hi> and <hi>vain-glory,</hi> and a conſtant endeavour of wholly reſigning our ſelves to God and his Service, who has wholly made us Body and Soul, and ſtrictly and conſcientiouſly walking according to <hi>His</hi> Will reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his <hi>written</hi> Word, that is the Method of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to a more near Communion with God, and the only way of more fully participating of his Spirit. And this certainly may as well be done holding ſtill Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as in any new-fangled way, that either the cunning of man or ſubtilty of Satan can invent. And therefore it is rather a <hi>wanton</hi> kind of <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> in men, or <hi>Inſincerity</hi> to <hi>true</hi> Religion <hi>indeed</hi> that makes them break from the eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion</hi> of the
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:34043:8"/>Church of <hi>England</hi> reformed according to the old <hi>Symmetral</hi> and Apoſtolical Pattern, than any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>Neceſſity</hi> driving them thereto.</p>
            <p>And thus much briefly to thoſe high-flown <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualiſts.</hi> But what I now ſhall utter is ſtill more weighty, foraſmuch as it concerns a greater number of men that have an honeſt inclination to Religion, but their Education, Parts and Calling do not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate them to make ſo ſtrict inquiry into the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines thereof, as others may make, but ſeek ſome <hi>external</hi> Authority to ſupport their Faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by lye obnoxious to the ſolicitations of the <hi>Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who boaſt ſo much of the ſafe Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of their Church. To theſe men therefore I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, what can be more ſafe for them than to adhere to the Autority and Profeſſion of the ancient Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick and <hi>truly</hi> Catholick Church, ſuch as it was found before the Apoſtaſie, and is bore witneſs to in the Oracles of the Holy Scripture, as I have above declared; To adhere, I ſay, and keep cloſe to this ſteady Rock, and ſtop their ears againſt the vain pretences of any idle Fanatical New Lights or bold Enthuſiaſts? Now he that adheres to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> does adhere to this ancient Apoſtolick Church, the Church of <hi>England</hi> being reformed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Pattern, as to the frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Articles of Faith; And for the Precepts
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:34043:9"/>of an holy Life, beſides what occurs in our Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, Litany and Catechiſm, they are ſo plain in the Scripture, and ſo fully and effectually declared by thoſe in our own Church in printed Sermons and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Writings, to ſay nothing of the good Preaching up and down, that no well-minded Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can want any due Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>This is a conſideration the beſt accommodate that I know to keep us all in one, which is to acknowledge the Autority and <hi>Undeceivedneſs</hi> in matters of any moment, though not <hi>Undeceivableneſs</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> of the ancient Catholick Church before the Apoſtaſie came in. Which true and juſt ground will give us all the Advantages and more than that falſe Boaſt of the Roman Church, as if ſhe forſooth were <hi>infallible,</hi> and therefore <hi>irrefragable;</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that one Tenent of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> alone ſufficiently demonſtrates it to be a groundleſs Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that Doctrine being plainly a Fardel of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities and Contradictions; to ſay nothing of their infinite Superſtitions, Impoſtures and groſs Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries, and barbarous and bloody Perſecutions and Murders for not ſubmitting to them. So that ſhe is a Church all over beſmeared with ſordidly-gainful Superſtitions, Idolatries and Blood. And therefore ſhe being deprehended ſo groſly and enormouſly erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, or impoſturous and deceitful, and ſupporting
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:34043:9"/>all her abſonous Opinions upon that ſingle pretence of her <hi>Infallibility,</hi> ſhe has manifeſtly forfeited her Credit before all the World, and moſt juſtly loſt her Autority, that no man that has leiſure and freedom to examine the Truth, can eaſily be perſwaded to rely or lean upon this broken Reed of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> which is a fictitious and certainly falſe Pretence to Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility by an Apoſtatized Church, ſhameleſly obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon thoſe they can deceive, all the Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are declared againſt in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> where the Viſions repreſent the ſtate of thoſe Times, into which this grand Apoſtaſie fell. How unſafe therefore is it for any one to repoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Autority of ſuch a Church! God open the eyes of all that mean ſincerely in Religion, that they never fall into ſuch a dangerous Ditch as this. But the Church of <hi>England</hi> keeping to the ancient Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral Church, to whom the Divine Oracles bear witneſs, is in truth <hi>infallible</hi> in the main Points above-mentioned, and in all things elſe material to Salvation, and therefore all ſorts of people, learned and unlearned, may ſafely emboſom themſelves in her, ſo long as ſhe continues, which I wiſh may be for ever.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we ſee what a mighty advantage it would be, if that, as our own Church in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ſo all the Reformed Churches would jointly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:34043:10"/>the ſame unexceptionable Pattern of Antiquity to be followed that bears a juſt Autority with it, which the generality of men may ſafely rely on, and that <hi>Independency</hi> and the guidance of <hi>private</hi> Spirits ſeducing men from the <hi>National</hi> Churches, framed to that ancient Platform, were quite out of faſhion in all Reformed Chriſtendom, and that all men with alacrity of mind and ſincerely loyal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, would ſhew themſelves morigerous to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governours. For this is the only effectual and warrantable way that I can conceive for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus, and the overthrowing the Kingdom of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>The other Scene of things, as I noted above, hardens the hearts of the Princes and Prelates of Chriſtendom, who cannot but think it a ſorry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to accept of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> which would prove but a <hi>Democratical</hi> Papacy, for the Order of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy,</hi> or a diſmal Spectacle to ſee the Body of Chriſt mouldred into an infinity of Sects and Schiſms, as a dead Carcaſs diſſolved into a multitude of craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling worms, and the decent grandeur and splendour of the Church to dwindle into diſperſed Companies of obſcure Conventicles, and the juſt and honourable Revenues of it to ſhrink into the poor arbitrarious Pittances of either the appointment of the <hi>State,</hi> or uncertain benevolence of the fickle <hi>People.</hi> That
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:34043:10"/>Scene of things, I ſay, cannot but harden their hearts againſt liſtening to never ſo juſt a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the further enlargement of Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and hazard the very Being of the Reformed Churches. Whenas this way, I wiſh may obtain, would ſilence <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Fanaticiſm</hi> at once, and be the readieſt means of bringing on thoſe happy Times of the Church which God has promiſed and predicted by the mouth of his holy Prophets.</p>
            <p>But this is the groſs iniquity and madneſs of the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> that they think ſo goodly and choicely every one of their own Party, that they think it worth the while to hazard the ſafety of Reformed Chriſtendom to ſupport any how and keep up for the preſent the ſmall freaks and conceits of their own ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſen Way and Sect. Than which nothing can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived more enormous and outragious amongst the dealings of the Sons of men, to bring into imminent danger ſo ſolemn and ſacroſanct a Conſtitution as the Reformation, for the Dreams and Opinions of <hi>private</hi> Spirits, which no ſober Chriſtian would hazard for ſmall indifferent dispenſable things, though they had the ſtamp of <hi>publick</hi> allowance upon them, which, it is and ought to be, in the hand of the Sovereign Power to alter for the common good. And verily this Fanatical diſtemper is ſo heinous and abominable, that they that are on the right ſide ought to take
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:34043:11"/>heed how in the leaſt ſhew they imitate it. For a man may be factiouſly affected in a right Cauſe, and bear an over-proportionated zeal for things of ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler concern out of an over-heightned Animoſity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preſent Sects, to the hazarding the quiet ſettlement of the whole. And if any one be ſo affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, I appeal to the ſober, if he may not juſtly be reputed to play the Sectarian himſelf, though it be againſt the Sectaries. No ſuch Cure for our Breaches and Wounds as the moſt profound <hi>Humility</hi> in all Parties, and unfeigned mutual Love and <hi>Charity.</hi> Of which Vertues or Graces, whoſoever is found deſtitute, let him call himſelf (of whatever denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as loud as he pleaſe, be has really in him not one spark of <hi>ſaving</hi> Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>This (or to this ſenſe at leaſt, and moſt what in the very ſame words) I wrote and publiſhed about two or three years ago (to fence Peoples minds from Popery, and reclaim them from <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to adhere to the ancient Primitive Church, according to which our Engliſh Church is reformed, and whoſe Principles ſhe profeſſes, and hath ever practiſed, as to the point of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians their <hi>not reſiſting</hi> the <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> though with <hi>undaunted</hi> Courage they profeſſed the Truth of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> againſt the <hi>Vanities</hi> and <hi>Idolatries</hi> of <hi>Paganiſm</hi>) and now
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:34043:11"/>for its preſent ſeaſonableneſs and uſefulneſs I have here tranſcribed it, if the ſincere vehemence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I writ it may but have a ſuitable effect for the perſwading the <hi>Sectaries</hi> to leave off their <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and reconcile themſelves to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Whereby, beſides the <hi>Purity</hi> and Decency of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip</hi> and ſoundneſs in the <hi>Faith, Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi> may be ſecured, and they become good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and good <hi>Subjects</hi> at once.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought fit to write by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to intimate the more particular Uſefulneſs of this preſent Treatiſe. Other things are taken notice of in the <hi>Introduction,</hi> in which then I was not aware that I ſhould have ſo much to do with thoſe affected <hi>Rationaliſts,</hi> who pretend that <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> especially thoſe of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe,</hi> are utterly unintelligible. In which conceit, though they may applaud themſelves as more ſpecial Admirers of dry <hi>Reaſon,</hi> yet I cannot ſee how their Opinion can well comport with ſerious <hi>Piety</hi> and a ſound Mind. For in their thus oddly adhering to their imagined Reaſon in this thing, they point-blank contradict the Scripture, which declares, <hi>Dan. 12.</hi> That the <hi>wicked</hi> indeed ſhall not underſtand, but the <hi>wiſe</hi> ſhall underſtand. And that is but a ſorry Triumph of <hi>Reaſon</hi> that is pretended to be over
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:34043:12"/>true <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> And then for the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> let us but conſider what Pomp and Applauſe the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Viſions of the <hi>Book-Prophecy</hi> to our Saviour from his Father is ſet out by; <hi>Apoc. Chap. V.</hi> and then judge of the unreaſonableneſs of this Imputation of <hi>Unintelligibleneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I ſaw in the right hand of him that ſat on the Throne a Book written within and on the back-ſide, ſealed with ſeven Seals. And I ſaw a ſtrong Angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the Book, and to looſe the Seals thereof? And no man in Heaven nor in Earth nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earth was able to open the Book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much, becauſe no man was found worthy to open and to read the Book, neither to look there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But at laſt the ſlain Lamb, <hi>v. 7.</hi> came and took the Book out of the right hand of him that ſat upon the Throne, and thereupon the four Beaſts and four and twenty Elders fall down before the Lamb, and to their Harps chant out this new Song, <hi>v. 9. Thou art worthy to take the Book, and open the Seals thereof, for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God,</hi> &amp;c. And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon this, <hi>v. 11.</hi> there is heard the voice of many Angels about the Throne, even of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:34043:12"/>times ten thouſand and thouſands of thouſands, ſaying with a loud voice, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain,</hi> &amp;c. Let us therefore in the fear of God conſider not only how ridiculous, but how blasphemous a thing it is to think that this pompous Introduction (than which nothing can be contrived more highly ſolemn and pompous) ſhould be to a Book of Prophecies that are utterly unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible; As if the incarnate Wiſdom did not only ſport with the Children of men, but delude and mock them. What can be conceived more horrid and impious? Wherefore without doubt the Viſions of the <hi>Book-Prophecy</hi> are clearly intelligible.</p>
            <p>And for the <hi>Epiſtolar Prophecy,</hi> the Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches, that they are alſo clearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, may appear from the <hi>Introductory</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there alſo. For Chriſt in his Pontifical Habit there dictates them. And therefore they are as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Oracles</hi> given out from the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi> of our High-Prieſt Chriſt Jeſus, which the <hi>Seventy</hi> interpret <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <hi>clear declaration</hi> and <hi>certain Truth,</hi> in counterdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to the obſcure and ambiguous Anſwers of the Heathen Oracles, and the Uncertainty of their Event.</p>
            <p>And this is an Argument for the <hi>Intelligible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi> Book of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe,</hi>
               <pb n="xx" facs="tcp:34043:13"/>it being <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the true High-Prieſt with his <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi>

And it is a flat Contradiction to the very Inſcription of this Book the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> or <hi>Revelation,</hi> if it were not <hi>intelligible,</hi> for then <hi>nothing</hi> thereby would be <hi>revealed.</hi> Wherefore to admit the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe</hi> to be a Book <hi>inſpired</hi> and not <hi>intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> that the Church of Chriſt may be edified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, is plainly to reproach Chriſt and the Spirit of Prophecy, and to ſet the <hi>Title</hi> of the Book and the <hi>Book it ſelf</hi> at odds.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Argument from the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> of our High-Prieſt to be confined to the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> but it will reach into <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Viſions alſo. Foraſmuch as in the <hi>Introduction</hi> to the Prophecy of <hi>the Scripture of Truth,</hi> Chap. <hi>10.</hi> Chriſt appears there alſo in his Pontifical Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and imparts the whole Prophecy <hi>(Chap. 11, 12.)</hi> of <hi>the Scripture of Truth</hi> unto <hi>Daniel.</hi> And as <hi>Palmoni,</hi> Chriſt our High-Prieſt, employs the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> to make <hi>Daniel</hi> underſtand the Viſion of the <hi>Evening</hi> and <hi>Morning,</hi> Chap. <hi>8.</hi> ſo queſtionleſs all the Prophetick Viſions in <hi>Daniel</hi> are

               </gap>, if he had but made <hi>Thummim</hi> to ſignifie Angels as well as <hi>Urim,</hi> which latter there is no queſtion but it does.

            <p>This ſeems to me infinitely more credible than that Conceit of <hi>Chriſtopher Caſter,</hi> that makes two <hi>ſtatuary</hi> Poppets of the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> which muſt needs bear out <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Breaſt-plate, very uglily and ill-favour'dly while they are there, beſides the ſcandal of bringing them out into view, and of converſing ſo with viſible vocal Images, which was the degeneracy of the ancient <hi>Ephod</hi> and <hi>Teraphim,</hi> as I noted above. But this ſquare Cloth-texture of gold and ſilk was placed handſomly and eaſily within the Breaſt-plate, and remained inviſible, but a Voice was heard coming forth as from before the Breaſt-plate, and was the ſure and true Oracle of God, and uttered haply by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of ſome inspired <hi>good</hi> Angel, as <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> put together ſignifie, and therefore

               </gap>, both <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of ſenſe and certainty of <hi>Truth,</hi> as I noted before. And all Oracles and Prophecies our High-Prieſt Chriſt Jeſus is entitled to we may be ſure are ſuch, which was the thing I drove at.</p>
            <p>Nor do I, I hope, raſhly diſſent from the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that Reverend Author, who has ſo much obliged the World by his Learned pains in giving an Account of the Ritual Laws of <hi>Moſes, quà Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;</hi> If either he or any one elſe would take the like pains to give an account of the ſaid Laws of <hi>Moſes, quà Propheta,</hi> it would be a very uſeful and commendable work. For I muſt confeſs I am prone to think, that the main of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and frame of things is one <hi>wonderful</hi> and <hi>illuſtrious Prophecy</hi> of Chriſt and his Church; that kind of Prophecy which is called <hi>Prophetia</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as other Prophecies are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and that this is the <hi>chief</hi> ſcope of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, as appertaining not to <hi>one</hi> Nation, an handful of people in compariſon, and but for a <hi>ſmall</hi> time, but to the Church of Chriſt which is to <hi>fill</hi> the <hi>whole World,</hi> and to laſt to the <hi>End of Ages.</hi> Beſides that the Reſolving of the Ritual Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> into his <hi>Political</hi> skill, only teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies he was a prudent Lawgiver and a wiſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the People, but the ſhowing they are eaſie,
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:34043:15"/>natural and lively Types of Chriſt and his Church demonſtrates that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a ſingular <hi>Prophet</hi> indeed, and illuſtrates the ſtupendious Foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and his Providence over his Church that he has ſo lively and exquiſitely prefigured the ſtate thereof in the Oeconomy of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo many Ages before.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of Chriſt and the benefit thereof is lively ſet out by the Erection of the <hi>bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent</hi> in the Wilderneſs. To ſay nothing of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> the <hi>red Heifer,</hi> and the like. And in the Feaſt of Expiation, though it was not fit nor could be, that <hi>Aaron</hi> (who yet doubtleſs was a Type of Chriſt) ſhould dye and riſe again, and aſcend into Heaven, of which the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum Sanctorum</hi> is a Type even of the higheſt and pureſt part thereof; yet inſtead of his <hi>own</hi> Blood, he entred into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> with the blood of a Bullock and Goat, which was a Type of the Bloodſhed of Chriſt, of whom <hi>Aaron</hi> was alſo a Type: which therefore plainly implies the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of Chriſt, who <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did</hi> the Type: and with his <hi>own</hi> Blood entred into the Holy of Holies. And whereas both the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> or Immortal Nature of Chriſt, and his <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial</hi> and Mortal could not be ſet out by one thing; <hi>two</hi> Goats are made to typifie them, the

And there is the like reaſon of the two Birds, one killed and the other let fly into the fields, <hi>Levit. 14.4.</hi> Theſe the more we ſearch into them, the more eaſie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Types they will be found of thoſe Paſſages touching Chriſt his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> as the entring of <hi>Aaron</hi> with the blood of the Goat (a Type of Chriſt (as to his Suffering) as well as <hi>Aaron</hi> was a Type of him) into the <hi>Sanctum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum,</hi> is a plain Type of his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> into Heaven, and <hi>Interceſſion</hi> there, in virtue of his own Blood ſhed on the Croſs in his Crucifixion.</p>
            <pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:34043:16"/>
            <p>But it is beſides my preſent Scope to inſiſt on theſe things. I will only give one Inſtance more, and that is of <hi>Aaron</hi> in his Prieſtly Habiliments: In which Spectacle we may ſo plainly read not only thoſe three Offices of Chriſt (whoſe Type he is) <hi>King, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> his golden Diadem denoting the <hi>firſt,</hi> his Veſtments in common with other Prieſts, the <hi>ſecond,</hi> and his <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> the <hi>laſt:</hi> (The durable effect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is diſcovered in thoſe Viſions, especially of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> that run through all the conditions of the Church to the End of the World) but there is yet a further Myſtery diſcernible, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> in that he is cloathed with the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> which is a Veſtment cannot belong to <hi>Aaron</hi> as a man, but as he is a Type of the Eternal <hi>Logos</hi> that made the World. See the <hi>Appendix</hi> to the <hi>Defence</hi> of my <hi>Philoſophick Cabbala,</hi> Chap. <hi>5.</hi> Sect. <hi>3, 4.</hi> And the Name <hi>Jehovah, viz.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But I must beg my Reader's pardon for this not altogether (I hope) uſeleſs Digreſſion. I had before made a competent Supply for my not beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one entire Chapter in my <hi>Paralipomena</hi> to prove the <hi>Intelligibleneſs</hi> of the Viſions of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> without which all endeavour to interpret them is ridiculous and vain. And I need the leſs here expatiate on this Argument, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilicrines Parrheſiaſtes</hi> in his <hi>Reflexions</hi> on <hi>R. B.</hi> having done ſo much of that work to my hand, but in a way that partakes much of <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Satyr,</hi> for which he may haply incur the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the more grave and ſowre, and it may be more for being <hi>merry</hi> than <hi>Satyrical.</hi> And the first I muſt confeſs is the greateſt infirmity I have obſerved in that Party. But it is a ſign he has all this time ſerved a good Maſter, and that it is not the deepneſs of Melancholy (as ſome ſuperficial Souls may be prone to phanſie) that has plunged his mind into ſuch ſerious ſtudies, as the ſearching out
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:34043:17"/>the right ſenſe of inspired Viſions and Prophecies, and the like, but that there is ſuch a Life and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in him that loves the exerciſe of Reaſon, Wit, and Divine Speculation at once.</p>
            <p>And if by that of <hi>Satyr</hi> any contempt fall upon <hi>R. B.</hi> for his contempt of the ancient Primitive Times of the Church, and for his preſumption of making himſelf a Guide to People upon his private Spirit againſt the wholeſom Inſtructions of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and Authority of both Crown and Mitre, and for his foul ſlurring, as much as in him lyes, the peculiar Priviledge and Glory of the Chriſtian Religion, as to have its ſtate from the beginning to the end ſo certainly prefigured by Divine Viſions and Prophecies, he hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally pretending the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> to be altogether unintelligible, now it is ſo clearly to be underſtood againſt <hi>Fanaticiſm</hi> and <hi>Bloodſhed,</hi> thus can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling the ſeaſonable uſefulneſs thereof, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dirt upon the pious and learned Labours of the beſt Writers of our Church: I ſay, if any contempt fall upon him from what of Satyr is found in thoſe <hi>Reflexions</hi> of <hi>Phililicrines Parrheſiaſtes,</hi> he may, as I conceive, fairly thank himſelf, there being nothing, I dare ſay, intended by that free <hi>Satyriſt,</hi> but the peace and good of the Church, and the reducing of <hi>R. B.</hi> to a better Judgment,
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:34043:18"/>and expoſing the profane and frivolous Spirit of thoſe that pride themſelves in a boaſtful profeſſion, that to them, forſooth, great Wits as they are! the holy Viſions of the Divinely inſpired Prophets, are altogether <hi>Unintelligible.</hi>

               <head>THE INTRODUCTION. <hi>The occaſion of the Author's writing his</hi> Paralipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena Prophetica. <hi>His deſign in writing them, to ſhow there is but one true way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting</hi> Daniel <hi>and the</hi> Apocalypſe. <hi>How himſelf was diſcouraged in his younger days by the variety of Interpretations; with a ſolution of that fallacy. His Apologie for his great care and diligence in managing this Province of rightly interpreting the above ſaid Prophecies.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHEN I wrote my <hi>Expoſitions</hi> of the Viſions of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe,</hi> I was ſolicitous only of theſe two things, that my continued Interpretations ſhould be unforced, natural and coherent, ſolid, true and agreeing with Hiſtory. And that I might diſpatch them as timely as I could for preſent publick uſe. Which latter therefore made me more compendious than otherwiſe I might have been; my main anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being, that nothing ſhould paſs my Pen, but what was ſound and true, not being at all careful
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34043:20"/>to bring all into view which might give further ſtrength and light to what I had written, or to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate all objections which, by ſcrupulous Wits, might be made. What therefore I may ſeem to have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then, I ſhall make a ſupply of now. And thoſe <hi>Omiſſions</hi> (which I therefore call <hi>Paralipomena,</hi> they being then paſſed by for the preſent, but) now for the further confirmation or illuſtration of ſeveral paſſages in thoſe Expoſitions compiled into one Book, I offer thus collected unto thy ſerious Peruſal.</p>
               <p>In which compilement I have obſerved no order, as in this caſe being needleſs; but as matters came into my mind, or occaſion was given, I writ and have ſet them down. They are eaſily referred to the paſſages of the <hi>Expoſitions</hi> themſelves, whether on <hi>Daniel,</hi> or the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> which are ſufficiently orderly and coherent. My main deſign in general is to make thoſe <hi>Expoſitions</hi> as ſetled and unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as poſſibly I can, that the Reader may perceive that the Interpretation of Prophecies is no ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and lubricous thing, but that there is one ſenſe of them genuine and natural, and far beyond any other pretended Interpretations whatever: That ſo he may be releaſed from that diſtraction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of multiplicity of Interpretations, which wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the belief of any, and makes the pretence of underſtanding Prophecies either heartleſs, or ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. I muſt confeſs, when I was young, that very thing hugely turned my ſtomach from thoſe ſtudies. But it might as well have done ſo from the ſtudy of Philoſophy; the reaſons of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature which Philoſophers give, being as various and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant as the Interpretations of a Prophecy. But that which is ſolid and ſound in either, when it is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34043:20"/>once light on, will plainly, by the impartial and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, be diſcerned to be ſuch, and he will reſt fully ſatisfied therein.</p>
               <p>That I ſhould manage this Province with ſo much care and ſolicitude, no man that has any kindneſs for Chriſtian Religion, can take amiſs, Prophecy being the peculiar ſtrength and glory of Chriſtianity, no Religion in the World being able to produce the like. Which being to many of ſo great moment, and of ſo clear and indubitable Interpretation in virtue of demonſtrable <hi>Synchroniſms</hi> and palpable <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> and exquiſitely ſuitable ſignificancy of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the Events, they do not only put the truth of Chriſtianity beyond all doubt, but is one of the moſt irrefragable Arguments for <hi>Natural</hi> Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Exiſtence of God and of Angels, and for a Divine Providence over the affairs of men, and a reward after this life, according to what we have done, whether it be good or evil, that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. But having more fully ſuggeſted theſe things in my <hi>Prefaces</hi> to my <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> I ſhall detain the Reader no longer here with them, but fall upon my preſent deſign.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Tho. Lydiat<hi>'s</hi> Epocha <hi>of the twentieth of</hi> Artaxerxes Longimanus <hi>for the compute of</hi> Daniel<hi>'s weeks more fully to be inſiſted on. Two undeniable</hi> Poſtulatums <hi>in order thereto. The paſſage of the Prophecy that reſpects the</hi> Epocha <hi>of the weeks. Four Decrees, but only two of them Competitors for the</hi> Epochate, viz. <hi>that of the ſeventh, and that of the twentieth of</hi> Artaxerxes, <hi>the one granted to</hi> Ezra, <hi>the other to</hi> Nehemiah. <hi>The Commiſſions granted to each, and ſome circumſtances of the execution of them. The comparing of them with the</hi> Epocha <hi>deſcribed in the Prophecy. That</hi> Nehemiah<hi>'s nuncupatory Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does the more exactly agree with the ſaid deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. That the Jews had never any Decree to build the walls of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>till that of</hi> Nehemiah. <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arguments to the ſame purpoſe. In what ſenſe the City may be ſaid to be built before the Commiſſion of</hi> Nehemiah. <hi>An Anſwer to an Objection from thoſe words,</hi> Ezra 9.9. to give us a wall. <hi>Further Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to prove that</hi> Ezra <hi>had no Commiſſion to build the walls of</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>The teſtimony of the Son of</hi> Sirach. <hi>No Commiſſion but that of</hi> Nehemiah <hi>had the</hi> Title <hi>of building the walls. That it is ſo plain a caſe, that</hi> Nehemiah<hi>'s Commiſſion is the true</hi> Epocha <hi>of the weeks, that learned men have betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to</hi> Lunar <hi>years to compute by, rather than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it. The unſucceſsfulneſs of that device.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE ſhall begin with that paſſage of the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks, that notable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy concerning the coming of Chriſt, and as clear,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34043:21"/>if rightly managed, as notable for its weight and importance. The paſſage is, the placing the <hi>Epocha</hi> of theſe ſeventy Weeks in the <hi>twentieth</hi> year of <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes Longimanus. Funccius</hi> and ſeveral others would fix it in the <hi>ſeventh</hi> of his Reign; which Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I was once inclined to my ſelf, till I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of the other. I have produced ſomething for the confirmation thereof out of <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi> in my <hi>Notes</hi> upon my <hi>Expoſition</hi> of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. But the buſineſs being of ſo great moment, I ſhall here reſume it again afreſh, that I may do him right by more fully bringing into view (and yet as briefly as may be) whether out of himſelf, or from elſewhere, what makes for the confirmation of his Opinion. And this I ſhall do gradually. Firſt, by ſetting down two <hi>Poſtulatums,</hi> which I hope no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man will ever deny me. Secondly, I ſhall repreſent out of the Prophecy it ſelf that part that reſpects the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Weeks, and out of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the ſtate of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, Whether of theſe two <hi>Epocha's</hi> bid the fairer to be the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the ſeventy Weeks? And laſtly, I will conſider the <hi>twentieth</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi>'s ſenſe what grounds he has for it. The two <hi>Poſtulatums</hi> are theſe.</p>

                     <hi>The firſt</hi> Poſtulatum.</head>
                  <p>That we are to acknowledge that ſenſe of any paſſage of a Prophecy, whether it reſpects the <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> thereof, or any other part, to be the true ſenſe, that is leaſt forced, or is moſt eaſie and natural, and moſt plainly agreeable to the words of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that does the leaſt or no violence to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34043:22"/>words of that paſſage whoſe ſenſe is controverted.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> is of it ſelf ſo clearly reaſonable, that nothing can be added to make it more firm, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this ill conſequence of denying it, that we ſhall not ever know when we have the right ſenſe of any Prophecy, or indeed of any place of Scripture elſe, if this be not the Touchſtone thereof.</p>

                     <hi>The ſecond</hi> Poſtulatum.</head>
                  <p>When Hiſtorians diſagree in their Story or Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology; foraſmuch as profane Hiſtory (as it is vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly called) is not infallible, but ſome may be right in one thing, ſome in another, we are to embrace that ſtory or paſſage of Chronology that ſuits beſt with, or does the leaſt violence to the certain Verity of the Sacred Writ. And there is the ſame reaſon of one and the ſame Hiſtorian that varies from himſelf, or writes in one place what is repugnant to what he has writ in another. We are to account that paſſage the trueſt that agrees beſt with the Holy Scriptures, and to acknowledge, as touching the other, that ignorance or inadvertence has miſguided his Pen.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> is as reaſonable and undeniable as the former, becauſe, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Truth is always conſonant to truth:</hi> whence that which is diſſonant thereto, muſt neceſſarily be falſe. Wherefore that Hiſtorian that ſpeaks conſonantly and conſiſtently with the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Holy Writ, in the thing that he ſo ſpeaketh, he is to be judged to ſpeak true, compared with the other that in the point, contradicts the Holy Writ; or if one and the ſame Hiſtorian ſpeak repugnantly to himſelf, if one part of that Repugnancy agrees
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34043:22"/>with the Sacred Text, the ſame is to be eſteemed the right, the other an errour or miſtake.</p>
                  <p>Now for that paſſage of the Prophecy that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Weeks, the words are theſe: <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25. <hi>Know therefore and underſtand, that from the going forth of the commandment to reſtore and build</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>unto the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>the Prince, ſhall be ſeven weeks, and threeſcore and two weeks; the ſtreet ſhall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the <hi>Epocha</hi> is to be taken without all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie from the going forth of a Command or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; of which there were four, one in the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> another in the ſecond year of <hi>Darius Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſpis,</hi> a third in the ſeventh year of <hi>Artaxerxes Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimanus,</hi> and a fourth in the twentieth year of his Reign. But the firſt Decrees, and conſequently the <hi>Epocha's</hi> from them, are pitched ſo high, that they fall many years ſhort, even of the Nativity of Chriſt, ſo that they are plainly ſhut out from any pretence of claim to be <hi>Epocha's</hi> of this Prophecy. The compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition therefore is only betwixt the Edict or Decree given out the <hi>ſeventh</hi> year of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> to <hi>Ezra,</hi> and that given out in the <hi>twentieth</hi> of his Reign to <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> Let us therefore conſider the Hiſtory of each, and whether of them agree beſt with the Prophecy, <hi>Ezra, Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 11. Now this is the Copy of the Letter that the King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> gave unto <hi>Ezra</hi> the Prieſt— <hi>v.</hi> 13. I make a Decree, That all they of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and of his Prieſts (<hi>viz.</hi> of the God of Heaven) and Levites in my Realm, which are minded of their own free will to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> go with thee. And ſo from this 13. <hi>v.</hi> to <hi>v.</hi> 25. all is concerning the Temple and the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34043:23"/>Prieſts and the Worſhp of the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But <hi>v.</hi> 25. his Commiſſion is enlarged to Civil Judicature. And thou, <hi>Ezra,</hi> after the Wiſdom of thy God that is in thy hand, ſet Magiſtrates and Judges which may judge all the People which are beyond the River, all ſuch as know the Laws of thy God, and teach ye them that know them not. And whoſoever will not do the Law of thy God, and the Law of the King, let Judgment be executed ſpeedily upon him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be unto Death, or to Baniſhment, or to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation of Goods, or to Impriſonment. This is the ſumm of the Decree given out the <hi>ſeventh</hi> year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> unto <hi>Ezra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that Commiſſion given to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is ſet down thus, <hi>Nehem. Chap.</hi> 2. And it came to paſs in the month <hi>Niſan</hi> in the <hi>twentieth</hi> year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the King, that wine was before him, and I took up the wine, and gave it to the King; Now I had not been before time ſad in his Preſence. Wherefore the King ſaid unto me, Why is thy countenance ſad, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou art not ſick? This is nothing but ſorrow of heart. Then I was very ſore afraid, and ſaid unto the King, Let the King live for ever. Why ſhould not my countenance be ſad, when the City, the place of my Fathers Sepulchres, lieth waſte, and the Gates thereof are conſumed with fire? Then the King ſaid unto me, For what doſt thou make requeſt? So I prayed to the God of Heaven; And I ſaid unto the King, If it pleaſe the King, and if thy ſervant have found favour in thy ſight, that thou wouldſt ſend me unto <hi>Judah</hi> unto the City of my Fathers Sepulchres, that I may build it. And the King ſaid unto me, For how long ſhall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleaſed the King to ſend me, and I ſet
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34043:23"/>him a time. Moreover, I ſaid unto the King, If it pleaſe the King, let Letters be given to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours beyond the River, that they may convey me over till I come into <hi>Judah.</hi> And a Letter unto <hi>Aſaph,</hi> the Keeper of the Kings Foreſt, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the Palace which appertained to the houſe, and for the wall of the City, and for the houſe that I ſhall enter into; and the King granted me according to the good hand of my God upon me. This is plainly a Grant from the King to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to build the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to wall it about.</p>
                  <p>We will add alſo out of <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. what ſtraits they were put to at the building of the wall, <hi>v.</hi> 7. And it came to paſs, that when <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah</hi> and the <hi>Arabians</hi> and the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and the <hi>Aſhdodites</hi> heard that the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were making up, and that the breaches began to be ſtopped, then they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wroth, and conſpired all of them together to come and fight againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and hinder it. And <hi>v.</hi> 16. And it came to paſs from that time forth, that the half of my ſervants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the Spears, the Shields, and the Bows, and the Habergeons— They which builded on the wall, and they which bare burdens, and thoſe that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and in the other hand held a weapon.</p>
                  <p>I have ſet before the Readers eyes that paſſage in the Prophecy that deſcribes the <hi>Epocha</hi> from whence the ſeventy weeks are to commence. It is from the going forth of a Decree or Grant to reſtore and build <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> The <hi>Streets,</hi> ſays the Decree or Prophecy, ſhall be built again, and the <hi>Wall,</hi> and that in <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:34043:24"/>times. Now in the Commiſſion given to <hi>Ezra,</hi> in the <hi>ſeventh</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s Reign, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of building the City, much leſs of the Walls, nor in the Hiſtory of the execution of that Decree any mention of troubleſom times. But quite contrary it is ſaid, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.36. And they delivered the Kings Commiſſion unto the Kings Lieutenants, and to the Governours on this ſide the River, and they furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the people and the houſe of God. But in the Commiſſion given to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the <hi>twentieth</hi> year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> there is mention of both building the <hi>City</hi> and the <hi>Wall;</hi> and in the Hiſtory of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commiſſion, there is mention of <hi>troublous</hi> times indeed, when they were forced to defend the workers at the Wall by Arms; nay, the very men that wrought at the Wall, were fain, as they did their work with one hand, to hold a Sword in the other. So exquiſitely does this Decree, and the Hiſtory of the execution thereof, ſuit with the words of the Prophecy which reſpect the <hi>Epocha</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. So that it cannot be but with infinite violence done to the Sacred Text, to pitch upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given to <hi>Ezra</hi> in the <hi>ſeventh</hi> year of <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes,</hi> inſtead of that given to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in the <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs that the full of <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Commiſſion is ſet down in writing in a more formal and ample way, whenas that Commiſſion to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be by word of mouth, or <hi>nuncupatory,</hi> ſaving that the Letters to the Governours beyond the River for ſafe-conduct, and a Letter to <hi>Aſaph</hi> the Keeper of the Kings Foreſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is ſo far from dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, that it adds (if any thing more need be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) to the certainty, that the Commiſſion given
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34043:24"/>to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is the Decree which is the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the ſeventy Weeks. For the words of the Original, which our Engliſh Tranſlation renders [from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the Commandment] are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is as much as to ſay, from the going forth of the Word, or pronouncing the Word that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be rebuilt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And both the vulgar <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Vatablus</hi> render it, <hi>ab exitu ſermonis;</hi> and the LXX. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>Now as this is unexceptionably plain in it ſelf, ſo it bears a moſt exact correſpondency with more paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Hiſtory, than I have yet taken notice of <hi>Nehem. Chap.</hi> 1. There <hi>Anani</hi> tells <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the welfare of his brethren at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the Remnant that are left of the Captivity there, in the Province, are in great affliction and reproach. For the <hi>Wall</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is broken down, and the <hi>Gates</hi> thereof are burnt with fire. This I conceive is the natural ſenſe of the place, we rendring (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) not <hi>praeterea,</hi> or <hi>alſo,</hi> as our Engliſh Tranſlation does, but <hi>[For]</hi> it being a grief to the Jews, and a reproach and diſgrace to them, whenas their Temple was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built, and they had houſes, ſuch as they were, and ſome better than they deſerved, before the Temple was finiſhed, (which was in the ſixth year of <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis</hi>) that the wall of the City was yet unbuilt, whereby they lay open to inſolencies of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and were obnoxious to their taunts and jears. This ſad condition <hi>Anani</hi> was exceeding ſenſible of himſelf, nor did he tell it as a piece of News to <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> (for he knew the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had been demoliſh'd this long time, and that the Gates were burnt with fire, but with a moving and empaſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Rhetorick he put him in mind of it; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34043:25"/>an hearty Lover of his Country, and ſeriouſly conſidering it, what an huge thing was yet wanting to complete their felicity, it firſt caſt him into tears, and preſently after into a ſerious religious ſadneſs, ſo that he faſted and prayed for ſome days, nor did conceal the ſorrow of his heart when he waited on the King, and gave him the Cup of Wine, but the King read it eaſily in his countenance. Wherefore the thing being of ſuch vaſt conſequence to have this evil redreſſed by procuring a Decree to build the City, and wall it about, it is plain they never had any leave to build it, till the Commiſſion granted to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah.</hi> For if it had been granted to <hi>Ezra</hi> in his Commiſſion, it was ſo tranſcending a favour and priviledge, that he could not but have taken notice of it in his thankſgiving to God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 27. where he ſays, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of our fathers, which hath put ſuch a thing as this in the Kings heart, to beautifie the houſe of the Lord which is in Jeruſalem:</hi> But for the building, or rather the rebuilding of the City, he ſpeaks not a word, though it was a thing of that vaſt moment, that it coſt <hi>Nehemiah</hi> many ſighs, tears, faſtings and prayers. Wherefore <hi>Ezra</hi> had been very ungrateful to omit giving God thanks for this, as well as beautifying the Temple, if the King had granted him any ſuch thing.</p>

                  <p>But being that thoſe that reſorted to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on this occaſion, were not to live, like Beaſts, without houſes: it is a forced thing to imagine, but that by the natural conſequence of that Grant, or neceſſary connivence, private houſes would be built in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and ſo in ſome meaner kind of ſenſe the City may be ſaid to be in building thereby. And this is conſonant to the words of the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Chap.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 28. that ſaith of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> He is my Shepherd, and ſhall perform all my pleaſure, even ſaying to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> Thou ſhalt be built, and to the Temple, Thy foundation ſhall be laid. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.13. I have raiſed him up in righteouſneſs, <hi>viz. Cyrus,</hi> he ſhall build my City, and let go my Captives. Which would be but an hard bargain, if they might not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34043:27"/>build themſelves houſes when they came to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Wherefore in that meaner ſenſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> may be ſaid by his Decree, though it was no Decree to build the City, to build it, or becauſe his firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, for building of the Temple, was the ground of all the good Grants they afterwards obtained of the Kings of <hi>Perſia.</hi> In that ſenſe all in fulneſs might be attributed to him, as being the firſt Founder of all.

Then ceaſed the work of the Houſe of God, which is at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo it ceaſed to the ſecond year of the Reign of <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Perſia:</hi> As if the Jews themſelves were conſcious, that the walls and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Temple were a kind of Fortification. But they are hugely out that phanſie, that by this wall <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is meant a Wall about the City for Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which before <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> they never had any Commiſſion to build; and it had been their undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if they had gone about it, <hi>Sanballat,</hi> you may be ſure, would have been on their backs to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they having no Commiſſion, when he was ſo vexatious to them when they had one. Nor is there any ſtory in <hi>Ezra</hi> touching their going about any ſuch work, no more than any mention in the Commiſſion for it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s application to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> plainly implies, that the Commiſſion <hi>Ezra</hi> had, had no clauſe in it to warrant the rebuilding of the Walls, and repairing the Gates which were broke down and burnt by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and ſo lay till that very time, though ſundry private houſes were rebuilt, ſome it may be in a better ſort, but moſt very mean,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34043:28"/>and hand over head without order. For if <hi>Ezra</hi> had had that Commiſſion, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would have framed his Petition accordingly, and reminded the King, that he only deſired him to ratifie again what he had before granted to <hi>Ezra,</hi> and told a ſad ſtory of <hi>Sanballat</hi> and his wicked Companions, that they had demoliſh'd the Wall, and burnt the Gates of the City, which <hi>Ezra</hi> by his Royal Grant had repaired again and built up. Which conſiderations could not but conduce to the more eaſie obtaining his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the King, which being omitted, plainly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues they were not true. And that there was no rebuilding of the City, in that proper ſenſe I above deſcribed, but by <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> of whom it is ſaid by the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> (<hi>Chap.</hi> 49.13.) having in the foregoing verſes ſpoke the praiſes of <hi>Zorobabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> who in their time builded the Houſe, and ſet up an holy Temple to the Lord, That amongſt the Elect was <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> whoſe renown is great, who raiſed up for us the Walls that were fallen, and ſet up the Gates and the Bars, and raiſed up our ruines again. So infinitely plain is it every way, that his was the <hi>only</hi> Commiſſion for the rebuilding the City and the Wall thereof, and is the only Commiſſion that has that <hi>Title.</hi> So that, if <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Commiſſion had any clauſe in it for the building of the City, as it aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had none; yet the Commiſſion of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> only bearing that <hi>Title,</hi> the granting of his Commiſſion muſt, by unavoidable neceſſity, be the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the ſeventy Weeks of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which is a point ſo plain and undeniable, that not only <hi>Julius Africanus</hi> of old, but alſo <hi>Daniel Huetius,</hi> a late learned and ingenious Writer, rather than he would quit this certain truth, that the <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:34043:28"/>of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks is from the Commiſſion grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> by <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in the <hi>twentieth</hi> of his Reign, adheres to that ancient Conceit, That the years that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks are to be numbred by, are not <hi>Solar</hi> years, but <hi>Lunar,</hi> which are leſs by eleven days in a year than the Solar, the Solar containing 365 days, the Lunar but 354. Which is ſomething an hard Hypotheſis, there being not an Example in all the Bible again of numbring of time by <hi>Lunar</hi> years. And <hi>Lyranus,</hi> who himſelf was an Hebrew, and very skilful in their Learning and Cuſtoms, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares expreſly, <hi>Falluntur,</hi> ſays he, <hi>qui putant He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeos lunaribus annis uſos aliquando, alioqui tota vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Inſtrumenti ſeries vacillet,</hi> as <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> cites him on the place. And indeed it ſeems impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but the Angel that imparted the Viſion to <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſhould mean ſuch years as would be moſt univerſally in uſe in the Church of God, who is ſo much concerned in this Prophecy. And beſides, if we compute from the Spring-time of the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> (for the Decree was made in the month <hi>Niſan</hi>) which twentieth year falls in with the 4269. year of the <hi>Julian Period,</hi> unto the Spring-time of the year which falls in with the year 4745. of the ſaid Period, when our Saviour ſuffered, <hi>viz. Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad.</hi> 202. <hi>Anno quarto finiente,</hi> and in the nineteenth year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign, according to <hi>Seth Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Funccius</hi> and <hi>Helvicus;</hi> this Interval of time will make 476 <hi>Solar</hi> years complete, which 476 <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> years make 173859 days with the Biſſextile days added to them, and divided by 354, give 491 <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar</hi> years with ſome 45 days over. So that by this account our Saviour would be ſo far from ſuffering in the midſt of the ſeventieth week, that his Paſſion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34043:29"/>would fall in the ſecond year after the expiration thereof: which is a thing intolerable.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT is neceſſary then to relinquiſh this old Conceit of <hi>Julius Africanus</hi> of computing <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks by <hi>Lunar</hi> years, though it is not without ſome Wit and Ingenie, while from that expreſſion of the LXX. [<gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Septuaginta Hebdomades abbreviatae ſunt ſuper populum tuum:</hi> he argues, that the Weeks muſt be computed by <hi>Lunar</hi> years, they being <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ſhorter years,</hi> than the <hi>Solar</hi> by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days in a year. But this ſhortneſs of the years makes their number exceed the ſeventy Weeks, and places the Paſſion of Chriſt in the ſecond year after their expiration, as I have noted already.</p>
               <p>And therefore there is a neceſſity of betaking our ſelves to that uſual and unexceptionable way of rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning by <hi>Solar</hi> years, and as great a neceſſity ſtill to ſtick to that indubitable <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Weeks, the <hi>twentieth</hi> year of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> though here we ſhall be caſt into great ſtraits, if we ſtick to the ordinary Opinion of Chronologers, who fix the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> in the firſt year of the 79. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and the 289. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.C.</hi> which <hi>Seth Calviſius, Helvicus,</hi> and <hi>Funccius,</hi> with others, agree in. Whence it will follow, that the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> will fall in with the fourth year of the 83. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and the 308. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.C.</hi> But now if the ſeventy Weeks commence in 308. <hi>

Whenas every School boy knows that <hi>Imperante Auguſto natus eſt Chriſtus, imperante Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio eſt crucifixus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This therefore is ſo groſs an abſurdity, that there is a neceſſity of placing the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in ſome ſenſe or other higher in Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34043:30"/>than it is uſually pitched. <hi>Petavius</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has eſpouſed this quaint Conceit, That the Reign of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> has two <hi>Epocha's;</hi> the one the ſame that <hi>Calviſius, Helvicus</hi> and <hi>Funccius</hi> agree in: the other ten years ſooner, namely, the twelfth year of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> or the third year of the 76. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> when he was aſſumed into the participation of the Empire by his Father <hi>Xerxes,</hi> at his going upon an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of <hi>Perſia:</hi> which he grounds upon that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in <hi>Herodotus, lib.</hi> 7. That there was a great ſtrife amongſt <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis</hi> his Sons, who ſhould be King, if he died in the War: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So that he ought to appoint who ſhould be King, according to the Law of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and ſo go upon his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. From this paſſage <hi>Petavius</hi> would infer, that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> reigned ſome years with his Father, he aſſuming him into a participation of the Empire ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time when he went to War out of the Empire of <hi>Perſia.</hi> And for the greater colour to this Conceit, he adds, This is the only way to ſalve the Credit of famous Hiſtorians, ſome whereof ſay, That <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles</hi>'s flight from the <hi>Athenians</hi> was in <hi>Xerxes</hi> his time, as <hi>Ephorus, Dinon, Clitarchus, Heraclides</hi> and <hi>Diodorus;</hi> others, that it was in his Son's time <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi> as <hi>Thucydides, Charon, Cornelius Nepos</hi> and <hi>Plutarch.</hi> Wherefore they both reigning together, the Credit of both Parties of the Hiſtorians is ſalved, they both ſaying true. And that he ſets the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s Reign with his Father ten years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Reign alone after his Father's death, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe taking the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Weeks from the <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth</hi> of his Reign, when he reigned alone, there will be ten years wanting to make our Saviour's Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34043:30"/>fall in the midſt of the week, as it is to fall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophecy of the ſeventy Weeks, it being granted, that he ſuffered in the fourth year to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ending of the 202. <hi>Olympiad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a trim Hypotheſis, if it were as ſolid as trim. For, Firſt, the main Baſis thereof, methinks, is very precarious, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> when they went to War againſt foreign Kingdoms in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, actually conſtituted one of their Sons King. The very words of <hi>Herodotus</hi> may import no more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> to declare who was to be King, or ſucceed in the Crown, if it ſhould ſo happen, that the preſent King were ſlain in the War.

                  </gap> here is to make one actually King, then this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king muſt be upon <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s entring upon that Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his againſt <hi>Greece</hi> the fifth year of his Reign; betwixt which, and the twelfth of <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Reign, there is ſeven years difference, which makes this Conceit utterly unſerviceable to the end it was invented for. And that he made any Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition himſelf, beſides that in Perſon, is incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the general Current of Hiſtorians declaring, as <hi>Pezelius</hi> obſerves, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> carried the War into <hi>Aſia,</hi> not the <hi>Perſians</hi> into <hi>Greece;</hi> nor that War, which was managed by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by <hi>Xerxes</hi> in Perſon, but only by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders. <hi>Diodorus</hi> names <hi>Tithrauſtes</hi> a baſtard Son of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and <hi>Pheredates, Xerxes</hi> his Nephew. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> indeed writes thus: <hi>Igitur</hi> Xerxes <hi>cùm proditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis dolum</hi> (namely, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his, who would have

               <p>And Thirdly and laſtly, It is a thing beyond all credibility, That whenas <hi>Ezra</hi> computes the Decree granted to him by <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> from the ſeventh year of his real Reign, or his reigning alone: (For if <hi>Xerxes</hi> had been alive, he had been named, and not <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>) that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> telling us he had his Commiſſion granted the <hi>twentieth</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> ſhould count from another <hi>Epocha</hi> ten years different from the former, and ſo puzzle and confound the Chronology of the Sacred Hiſtory, and of ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Prophecy. Theſe few things are enough to ſhow the vanity of this ſurmiſe. But if any one would be more fully ſatisfied, let him read <hi>Daniel Huetius</hi> his <hi>Demonſtratio Evangelica,</hi> Prop. 9. pag. 370.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:34043:32"/>
               <p>As for the ſalving the Credit of theſe differing Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians by this quaint device, it will be more ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to ſpeak to that hereafter. In the mean time there being a neceſſity to keep to the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>twentieth</hi> year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s Reign, and not only to number by <hi>Solar</hi> years, but from the twentieth year, as we are now convinced, of his Reign from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Xerxes</hi> his death, he that can make out the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Reign in this ſenſe, ſo that from the twentieth year thereof, if we count <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks, the Crucifixion of our Saviour will be found in the midſt of the laſt of theſe Weeks, this man muſt merit immortal praiſe, for this excellent piece of ſervice he has done the Church of Chriſt and Chriſtianity.</p>

               <p>In the mean time we are to note, That this fixing of the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Artaxerxes Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi> in the ſecond year of the 77. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which is at leaſt ſix years higher than other Chronologers place it, is no fictitious or arbitrarious thing, but a thing neceſſary, and firmly made out by moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Hiſtory. For firſt, the flight of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:34043:33"/>into <hi>Aſia</hi> to get to the King of <hi>Perſia, Tho. Lydiat</hi> has made out with undeniable clearneſs out of <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Siculus,</hi> that it was the ſecond year of the 77. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and <hi>Petavius</hi> himſelf acknowledges the truth thereof. Now when he was upon his journey, that he made no delay, but got thither in a ſhort time that very year, appears from what <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes in his Life, That when he had arrived to <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> a Town near the Sea, he made no ſtay there for fear of the Overſeers of Sea-affairs, eſpecially <hi>Ergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teles</hi> and <hi>Pythodorus,</hi> but betook himſelf preſently to <hi>Aegae,</hi> a Town in the ſame Country of <hi>Aeolia,</hi> where he was entertained by his Friend, to whom alone he was there known, one <hi>Nicogenes</hi> (a Perſon of great Quality and much Riches, and befriended much by the Nobles of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court) with whom having ſtayed but a few days, after Supper upon a certain Sacrifice, <hi>Nicogenes</hi> Childrens School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter <hi>Olbius,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, being in a Divine rapture, cried out in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Which words, as it ſeems, implied, Night would prove Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and ſuggeſt ſuch counſel to him as would prove very ſucceſsful. After this therefore <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> falling aſleep, dreamed he ſaw a Dragon winding about his belly, and creeping up to his neck; but aſſoon as it touched his face, that it was changed into an Eagle, which ſpreading his wings, took him up, and carried him a long way, and ſet him firmly upon a <hi>Caduceum</hi> or Heralds ſtaff made of Gold, freeing him thus from immenſe fear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation of mind. Wherefore upon this, <hi>Nicogenes</hi> preſently ſent him away to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court in ſuch a cloſe Coach as their Women uſe to be carried in.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34043:34"/>And the leſs ſtay then in his journey, certainly it was the better. It is plain therefore, that this very year <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> came to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court.</p>
               <p>But whether to <hi>Xerxes</hi> or <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Son, is a Queſtion amongſt Chronologers from the different Reports of Hiſtorians. And ſome alſo make a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> be not Names or Titles promiſcuouſly uſed for a King of <hi>Perſia; Artaxerxes</hi> ſignifying no more than great <hi>Xerxes,</hi> as if one ſhould ſay one while the <hi>Mogul,</hi> another while the great <hi>Mogul. Cornelius à Lapide</hi> is expreſly for this conceit upon the Weeks of <hi>Daniel: Hiſtorici,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſubinde confundunt nomina haec</hi> Xerxes <hi>&amp;</hi> Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes. Xerxes <hi>enim Perſicè ſignificat Bellatorem,</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes <hi>magnum Bellatorem.</hi> But I think it is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without Controverſie, That <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> came to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court the very ſame year he ſet out in, and as ſhall be made out, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> died, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> began to reign in, and in all likelihood very near the time, not many months diſtance from the <hi>exitus</hi> of the one, and ſucceſſion of the other. For the Right of the Kingdom devolved immediately upon <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> ſo ſoon as he was next Heir to the Crown. Wherefore <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> coming to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Court in ſuch a nick of time, I mean ſo near to the contermination of the <hi>Exitus</hi> of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and the ſucceeding of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> it is the leſs to be wondred at, that ſome Hiſtorians ſay, he came to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> others to <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi>

               <p>BUT <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi> produces the irrefragable Authority of that unexceptionable Hiſtorian <hi>Thucydides,</hi> that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> came to the Son of <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes,</hi> viz. <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>newly coming to the Throne.</hi> Whence it is undeniably true, that <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> began his Reign the ſecond year of the 77. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which was the thing to be demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charon Lampſacenus</hi> alſo a Perſon of Quality, and a famous Hiſtorian, he likewiſe declares, that <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi>'s flight and addreſs was to the Son, not to his Father <hi>Xerxes,</hi> his Father, as he writes, being dead. And who, I pray, ſhould be a more idone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Witneſs, than he who lived and flouriſhed in that time, and whoſe native Town was <hi>Lampſacum,</hi> which <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> gave to <hi>Themistocles</hi> to yield him Wines, as he did <hi>Magneſia</hi> to yield him Bread-corn,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34043:35"/>and <hi>Myus</hi> the delicacy of Victuals, that Town ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> alſo is of opinion, that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his addreſs was to the Son of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> not to <hi>Xerxes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who was dead, and readily ſubſcribes to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> and of <hi>Charon Lampſacenus</hi> in this, as more conſentaneous to the truth of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology. And <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> prefers the Authority of <hi>Thucydides</hi> before all thoſe that write the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Quòd aetate proximus erat qui illorum temporum hiſtoriam reliquerunt, &amp; ejuſdem Civitatis fuit,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an <hi>Athenian,</hi> as <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was, of which <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Lydiat</hi> makes excellent uſe, as you may ſee in his <hi>Emendatio Temporum, An. Mund.</hi> 3534. And for that paſſage of <hi>Nepos, [Qui illorum temporum hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriam reliquerunt]</hi> what can it more fitly relate to, than the Hiſtory of <hi>Charon Lampſacenus,</hi> who was contemporary to <hi>Themiſtocles, Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes,</hi> and was born at that very Town <hi>Lampſacum,</hi> (and reckoned by <hi>Strabo</hi> amongſt the <hi>Illuſtres Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſaceni</hi>) which <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> beſtow'd with the other two upon <hi>Themiſtocles?</hi> Whoſe Teſtimony can be ſo much credited, as ſuch an one as he? But <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides</hi>'s Teſtimony alone is of that value, that <hi>Pezelius</hi> conceives, that from thence that excellent and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Hiſtorian <hi>Johannes Sleidanus</hi> declares thus; Xerxi <hi>ſucceſſit filius</hi> Artaxerxes Longimanus, <hi>ad hunc</hi> Themiſtocles <hi>exul profugit, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore here is moſt ample and authentick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, <hi>Charon Lampſacenus, Thucydides, Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Nepos,</hi> that it was <hi>Artaxerxes Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> not <hi>Xerxes,</hi> to whom <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile made his applications. But, methinks, I hear you ſay, <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the ſame place where he ſubſcribes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34043:35"/>to <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Charon,</hi> tells us, that <hi>Ephorus</hi> and <hi>Dinon</hi> and <hi>Clitarchus</hi> and <hi>Heraclides,</hi> with ſeveral other Hiſtorians, ſay, that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi>'s addreſs was made to <hi>Xerxes.</hi> It may be ſo. But from thence it is then more clear, what a great value he had for the Truth and Authority of thoſe two Writers, when he preferred their two Teſtimonies before the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſo many. For the voices of many are not ſo conſiderable in ſuch caſes, the miſtake of one famous Hiſtorian, ſuch ſuppoſe as <hi>Herodotus,</hi> making all that ſucceed him, follow him; as when one Sheep on a Bridge leaps off the Bridge into the water, it endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers all the reſt that follow, to leap after him. But <hi>Charon Lampſacenus</hi> was out of this danger, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much ſeniour to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and flouriſhing in the very times of <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> whenas <hi>Herodotus</hi> was born but four years before <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Expedition into <hi>Greece.</hi> And we may be ſure, that <hi>Thucydides,</hi> who was ſo extreme careful of writing nothing but what was true, conſulted <hi>Charon Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſacenus</hi> (who lived and flouriſhed in the times of <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes:</hi> and wrote the <hi>Perſian</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of his Times, to which his own were ſo near, or rather coincident.) For which very cauſe <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Nepos</hi> prefers his Teſtimony before any other that contradict it.</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>Ephorus,</hi> he is a good while after <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides,</hi> and it is <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Character of him, Ephorus <hi>non religioſiſſimae fidei ſaepe decipitur, ſaepe decipit. Dinon,</hi> though much later than he, <hi>Nepos</hi> ſeems to have a good opinion of; but <hi>Pliny</hi> laughs at him for his <hi>Indian</hi> Sirens, who, he ſays, by their ſweet ſinging lull men aſleep, and in their ſleep ſeize on them, and devour them. And for <hi>Clitarchus</hi> that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34043:36"/>followed <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great in his Expedition into <hi>Aſia, Quintiliaeus</hi>'s Elogium of him is, <hi>Clitarchi proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ingenium, fides infamatur.</hi> Now for <hi>Heraclides,</hi> there were many of that Name, and thoſe Hiſtorians too; but it's likely this was <hi>Heraclides Cumanus</hi> who wrote five Books, <hi>De rebus Perſicis,</hi> junior to <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchus:</hi> he ſeeming to be ranged with thoſe that lived in <hi>Ptolemaeus Philometor</hi>'s time by <hi>Gerardus Voſſius,</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>De Hiſtoricis Graecis;</hi> but for his Character, I find none cited by <hi>Voſſius</hi> either good or bad out of any Author. And it may be, it was not altogether neceſſary to mention thoſe of the other, there being another way of anſwering, and more conſiſtent with their Credits.</p>
               <p>For being it is merely known of them, that they relate <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his addreſs, when he fled into <hi>Aſia,</hi> to have been made to <hi>Xerxes;</hi> according to <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi>'s Opinion, there being no more difference betwixt <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Mogul</hi> and the great <hi>Mogul,</hi> (for <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> ſignifies no more than the great <hi>Xerxes</hi>) thoſe that ſay he came to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> may be judged to ſay the ſame thing that they who-relate he came to <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes.</hi> And this is the very way that <hi>A Lapide</hi> ſalves the credit of theſe ſeemingly claſhing Hiſtorians. To which I will further add, That <hi>Themiſtocles</hi>'s flight into <hi>Aſia,</hi> being ſo near the contermination of the Death of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and the Succeſſion of his Son <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi> who was Heir to the Crown aſſoon as his Brother <hi>Darius</hi> was ſlain, which was immediately upon the death of <hi>Xerxes</hi> killed by <hi>Artabanus:</hi> the Credit of theſe claſhing Hiſtorians is ſufficiently ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in that the errour in time is ſo very little, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſay <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> came to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court

               <p>BUT there is one more beſides thoſe four that <hi>Plutarch</hi> names, taken notice of by <hi>Petavius,</hi> which I muſt confeſs this <hi>Salvo</hi> will not reach, and that is <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> who placing the flight of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> in the ſecond year of the 77. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> does notwithſtanding place the death of <hi>Xerxes</hi> in the fourth year of the 78. <hi>Olympiad;</hi> ſo that <hi>Xerxes,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, lived five or ſix years after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> in <hi>Perſia.</hi> Wherefore here we muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, that <hi>Diodorus</hi> has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a miſtake, though otherwiſe a very creditable Hiſtorian. But it is a conſequential miſtake to a more primitive Errour, which he had imbibed from <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who makes <hi>Darius Hystaſpis</hi> to have
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34043:37"/>reigned five years longer than in truth he did. Which therefore muſt needs ſhove down the beginning of <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Reign (whom all are agreed to have reigned but about twenty years) and conſequently the beginning of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s Reign, five years lower than in truth it was.</p>
               <p>But though this muſt be acknowledged an errour in <hi>Diodorus,</hi> yet we are to pardon him from that modeſt deference he gave to the Authority of <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,</hi> he being reputed <hi>Parens Hiſtoriae,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> calls him, <hi>the Father of Hiſtory;</hi> and alſo becauſe by his happy diſcovery of the true time of <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>'s flight to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> he has again reſcued us from that inveterate Errour of <hi>Herodotus; Charon</hi> and <hi>Thucydides,</hi> two unexceptionable and irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authors, and elder than all that have related to the contrary, affirming, that it was <hi>Artaxerxes Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimanus</hi> that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> came to, and that at the beginning of his Reign. But this coming of <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles, Diodorus</hi> aſſures us was in the ſecond year of the 77. <hi>Olympiad.</hi> And therefore it is apparent, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> died five or ſix years earlier in the ſeries of time than <hi>Diodorus</hi> makes him, though acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all to have reigned twenty years, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about.</p>
               <p>Whence his Father <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity not have reigned above thirty one years, or thereabout, as <hi>Cteſias Cnidius</hi> alſo affirms he did not, who being Phyſician to <hi>Artaxerxes Memor,</hi> had the opportunity to know the truth of theſe things better than <hi>Herodotus.</hi> And it ſeems a ſpecial piece of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, though length of time, or careleſneſs of Tranſcribers, may have corrupted other numberings of his, that this of the Reign of <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis</hi>

                  <hi>Hecataeus Mileſius</hi> indeed is ſomething ancienter than <hi>Charon,</hi> he flouriſhing in the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis,</hi> and being longaevous, may well reach many years beyond his Reign; and if his Hiſtory (for ſome make this <hi>Hecataeus</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Hiſtory, and <hi>Herodotus</hi> to have gleaned from him) was kept incorrupt without miſtakes of the Tranſcribers, and ſo came to <hi>Herodotus</hi> his hand, it might have been a ſafe direction touching the years of <hi>Darius</hi> his Reign.

               <p>Such a ſlight <hi>Salvo</hi> as this, is more for the credit of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> than to phanſie that he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produce the Reign of <hi>Darius</hi> about five years longer than in truth it was, that he might give him room enough to make vaſt preparations for War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> after his defeat at <hi>Marathon,</hi> and ſo have occaſion to bring in the pretty ſtory of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maratus</hi> aſſiſting <hi>Xerxes</hi> in his pleading for Succeſſion in the Kingdom, that his Father <hi>Darius,</hi> as the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>

               </head>
               <p>BUT to let go the uſe of that mawling Engine for the preſent, I will add ſome few Proofs more out of humane Authority, ſuch as occur in <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi>'s <hi>Canones Chronici.</hi> Where firſt he alledges that paſſage in <hi>Thucydides</hi> in the very Proem of his Book, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34043:39"/>&amp;c. that is, <hi>Paulóque ante</hi> Medicum <hi>bellum, ac</hi> Darii <hi>mortem, qui post</hi> Cambyſen <hi>regnum</hi> Perſarum <hi>obtinuit,</hi> &amp;c. Where he argues from <hi>Thucydides</hi> his immediately joining the Death of <hi>Darius</hi> with the <hi>Pugna Marathonia,</hi> where the <hi>Perſians</hi> were quite overthrown and vanquiſhed, that <hi>Darius</hi> his death muſt be dependent upon this, and that he ſurvived but a very little while that great defeat given him and his Army, as <hi>Cteſias</hi> relates the ſtory, that after he had returned into <hi>Perſia</hi> from that Expedition, he fell ſick, and lay by it ſome thirty days, and ſo died after he had reigned thirty one years; which therefore muſt needs be preſently after the <hi>Pugna Marathonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ill ſucceſs of that War, which <hi>Thomas Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat</hi> notes in the ſecond place, is thought by ſome to have broke his heart, which is an eaſie and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conjecture. And <hi>Georgius Syncellus,</hi> a Greek Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian, who lived in the time of <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> and <hi>Irene,</hi> whether upon the Authority of <hi>Cteſias Cnidius</hi> or <hi>Dinon,</hi> or ſome other, even of thoſe Greek Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians that declare, that <hi>Themistocles</hi> his communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was with <hi>Xerxes</hi> (for by reaſon of the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his flight to the contermination of <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Death and ſucceeding of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> that is conſiſtent enough) does not only relate, that after ſome days ſickneſs upon his return into <hi>Perſia, Darius</hi> died after he had reigned thirty years: But he adds further, that <hi>Cladis contumeliam indignè ferens, animo dolore exulcerato, occubuit. Scaliger</hi> indeed crows over this <hi>Georgius Syncellus</hi> for committing ſeveral and ſome groſs miſtakes in Chronology, but ſo <hi>Petavius</hi> does over <hi>Scaliger,</hi> as well as <hi>Georgius Syncellus</hi> over <hi>Euſebius</hi> (as <hi>Gerard Voſſius</hi> tells us) and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34043:39"/>that rudely enough; but withal <hi>Voſſius</hi> confeſſes, <hi>Syncellum ſaepe meritò ab</hi> Euſebio <hi>diſſentire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Out of the <hi>Chronicon Marmoreum Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delianum</hi> he alledges, that on one Marble there is an Inſcription that records the Battel at <hi>Marathon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> to have been ſuch an one being <hi>Archon</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> but the name it ſelf, the Marble being injured by time, is defaced. But what follows, is, that there was another of that name heretofore <hi>Archon,</hi> namely <hi>Phanippus,</hi> as will appear out of <hi>Plutarch.</hi> For the ſame Marble tells, that <hi>Darius</hi> died, and his Son <hi>Xerxes</hi> ſucceeded him that year that <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was <hi>Archon.</hi> Now therefore out of <hi>Aristides</hi>'s Life in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> where it is expreſly ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Phanippus,</hi> in whoſe time the <hi>Athenians</hi> won the Battel at <hi>Marathon, Aristides</hi> was preſently made <hi>Archon</hi>) he rightly infers, that <hi>Darius</hi> died a little after his return into <hi>Perſia</hi> from the War againſt the <hi>Greeks;</hi> And did not ſurvive five years after it, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> would make us believe he did. For he ſhows alſo, that <hi>Phanippus</hi> was <hi>Archon</hi> the firſt year of the 48. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> as the Marble intimates, there was one of the ſame Name <hi>Archon</hi> heretofore that he was of, that was <hi>Archon</hi> when the <hi>Marathonian</hi> Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel was fought. So exquiſitely do all things agree.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, That <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> came to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> not to <hi>Xerxes</hi> (as <hi>Thucydides</hi> alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly relates, that after he arrived into <hi>Aſia,</hi> he wrote a Letter, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, To King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the Son of <hi>Xerxes</hi> newly reigning, or newly begun to reign. Which ſhews, that <hi>Darius</hi> died what time <hi>Cteſias</hi> and the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34043:40"/>
                  <hi>Chronicon Marmoreum</hi> relate he did) he proves from a plain Narrative, where there is no mention of any vociferant Ecſtatical <hi>Olbius,</hi> or any Divinatory Dream of a Dragon, Eagle and golden <hi>Caduceum;</hi> but it is an unaffected ſtory of his Exile, and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival into <hi>Perſia,</hi> his Communication with the King, and the ſucceſs thereof written by <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his own hand in a Letter to <hi>Polygnotus,</hi> his intimate Friend, after his return from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court, and his Reſidence near the Sea-coaſts in the Prefecture of <hi>Artabazus</hi> in the leſſer <hi>Aſia.</hi> Which Letter, as I ſaid, is written with that unaffectedneſs and punctualneſs withal, and ſo conſentaneouſly to the true Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>Gelo</hi>'s Reign, and the Succeſſion of his Brother <hi>Hiero,</hi> which <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi> had exquiſitely made out in a ſingle <hi>Diatriba</hi> of his about that matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he met with <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his Epiſtles, or the <hi>Chronicon Marmoreum,</hi> that whatever may be thought of the eleventh Epiſtle, which is to <hi>Leager</hi> (which is filled with abundance of Wit and Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and ranting Paſſion in it; beſides, that it makes as if there were intercourſe of Letters betwixt the <hi>Perſian</hi> King and <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> while he was at <hi>Epheſus</hi> where he firſt landed) this Epiſtle as well as any of the others, and it is unlikely but that there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Epiſtles written by ſo great a Man in ſuch exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of affairs, and that the Nobleneſs of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and greatneſs of his Fame, would make men careful to preſerve them; this Epiſtle, I ſay, muſt needs be genuine.</p>
               <p>But in this unexceptionable Epiſtle it is clear, that the flight of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was near the contermination of <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s death, and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s ſucceeding him. For ſo ſoon as he was got to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> there, ſays he, I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34043:40"/>found certain <hi>Perſians,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-Souldiers of <hi>Caria,</hi> whom <hi>Artabazus</hi> had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there. And now, ſays he, I could ſafely make known who I was, even to <hi>Xerxes;</hi> which ſhows plainly, that at firſt he took <hi>Xerxes</hi> to be ſtill alive; but being better informed by the Souldiers, he holds on, and ſpeaks more cautiouſly, and ſays I told them my Name, and ſaid, I came <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to do great ſervice to the King's houſe, that is, to his Family or Off-ſpring. Theſe Souldiers, ſays he, told <hi>Artabazus</hi> what I ſaid, and they led me to the <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> for <hi>Artabazus</hi> was in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> who when he heard the reſt from my ſelf, and my purpoſe of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the King (and certainly there was but one King then) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he liked my deſign, and ſent me away forthwith, and beſtows on me two Horſes and two Servants, beſides that he appointed thirteen <hi>Perſians,</hi> to whom were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the care of conducting him, and providing all neceſſaries, as he went, for his journey.</p>
               <p>What a plain and unaffected an account is this of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his own, in compariſon of that which I briefly above recited out of <hi>Plutarch;</hi> but both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in this, that he haſted away preſently (aſſoon as he arrived into <hi>Aſia</hi>) unto the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court, which is the thing I drove at then, and note here again; That no ſlippery Wit may pretend, that though <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>'s flight indeed was the ſecond year of the 77. <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad,</hi> yet there may be ſome years before he came to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court; and though it was <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> that he then addreſſed to, yet it does not follow, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> died in the ſecond year of the aboveſaid O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad. But as it is plain out of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> that <hi>Xerxes</hi> was dead in this very year of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi>'s
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34043:41"/>flight, ſo it is more manifeſt ſtill out of this Epiſtle of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> to <hi>Polygnotus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which he writes thus, a little after he has given a brief deſcription of the Journey he had. And at laſt, ſays he, we finiſhed our Journey, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and we came to the King, whither we haſted. If there had been two Kings then reigning, <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Son, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he would have intimated ſo much; and if there were, yet he not giving notice to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Xerxes</hi> the Father muſt neceſſarily be underſtood by the King here. And then conſider what ſenſe that Saying of the King to him will have. Art thou the <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> which the <hi>Medes</hi> ſay, [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] to have been the cauſe, that neither I nor my Father became Maſters of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or Maſters of <hi>Greece.</hi> What, does the King when he ſays, [my Father] mean <hi>Darius Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſpis?</hi> No ſurely, he means <hi>Xerxes,</hi> as is manifeſt from <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his Anſwer. Wherein he recounts what ſervice he did <hi>Xerxes</hi> in haſtening his Navy to <hi>Salamis,</hi> and after in diſſwading the <hi>Greeks</hi> from cutting the Bridge over the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> on purpoſe that <hi>Xerxes</hi> might ſafely eſcape. Wherefore it is as clear as the Sun, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> was dead that year when <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> fled to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court; and conſequently that the Reign of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> begins in the ſecond year of the 77. <hi>Olympiad, viz.</hi> ſix years ſooner than the vulgar Chronologers place it, who pretend it began not till the fourth year of the 78. <hi>Olympiad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is no raſh Aſſertion, nor deſtitute of Hiſtory, but a ſolid Truth, confirmed by the Authority of <hi>Charon Lampſacenus,</hi> of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> of <hi>Cteſias Cnidius,</hi>

               </head>
               <p>BUT the moſt terrible Argument againſt this ſo ſound a Truth is the Canon of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> which <hi>Petavius</hi> and others have taken notice of, and which aſſigns thirty ſix years to <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis.</hi> As for the Antiquity of it, I find neither in <hi>Petavius,</hi> nor <hi>Scaliger,</hi> nor <hi>Calviſius,</hi> (for it is not a Canon made,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34043:42"/>but only made uſe of by <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> it was extant long before his time) any thing ſaid thereof. But that which is moſt probable, and may make moſt for the Credit of it, may be this ſurmiſe, That ſome Greek <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> that accompanied <hi>Alexander</hi> in his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> either to ſatisfie his own curioſity, or the curioſity of ſome Friend, got this Canon of the Succeſſions of the Kings of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Which all Hiſtorians and Chronologers look upon as a conſiderable and uſeful Record.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe it exact and right at firſt, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of time, and negligence of Scribes, may well have much corrupted it, though <hi>Scaliger</hi> will ſcarce allow it was right at firſt. For in the third Book of his <hi>Canones Iſagogici</hi> he calls it indeed <hi>Egregium Vetuſtatis Monumentum,</hi> if it had been inconta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate. <hi>Sed vanidica,</hi> ſays he, <hi>&amp; futilis Genethlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum Natio regum quidem ipſorum memoriam fideliter conſervavit, annos verò eorum foediſſimè conturbavit.</hi> And he acknowledges, as <hi>Petavius</hi> and other Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers do, that the ſumm of the years from the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Nabonaſſar</hi> to the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, <hi>viz.</hi> 424 years, is right, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the years of the Reign of ſome particular Kings may be uncertain and diſputable. The very words of <hi>Petavius</hi> in his <hi>De doctrina Temporum,</hi> lib. 3. cap. 52. concerning the <hi>Canon Mathematicus Babylonio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Regum,</hi> as it is there ſtiled, out of <hi>Georgius Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> I ſuppoſe, he ſays, that though the ſumm of the <hi>Anni collecti</hi> be right, <hi>In aliis tamen quibuſdam mendoſus eſt Canon, quòd ſigillatim propriis locis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabit.</hi> And ſo both he and <hi>Scaliger</hi> make no bones of mending the Canon out of <hi>Beroſus</hi> and ſuch like Hiſtorians where-ever they conceive it faulty.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:34043:43"/>
               <p>And can we perſwade our ſelves, beſides what the injury of time may have done, and the careleſneſs of Tranſcribers, that long before <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Age, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and partiality of buſie Correctors of this <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Canon, may not have added ſome faults to it, and ſo they preſuming upon the Authority of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Hiſtory <hi>Herodotus</hi> that adds five years more to <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis</hi> his Reign than is due, when the ancient Canon had but <hi>thirty one,</hi> that they may not have made bold to make it thirty ſix, either to ſave the credit of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> or of the Canon it ſelf, that it might not ſeem to contradict the Authority of that Father of Hiſtory? Some bold <hi>Greek</hi> that had to do with this Canon, might very early make this falſe correction, and that the ſumm of the years might not be diſturbed, whenas <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> reigned 46 years, make him reign but forty one.</p>
               <p>Nor does this Errour paſſing the hands of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy</hi> even in that moſt correct MS. of this Canon that Dr. <hi>Overall,</hi> Dean of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, ſent to <hi>Calviſius,</hi> and which he has inſerted into his <hi>Iſagoge Chronologica,</hi> afford any credit to it, as to be therefore concluded a Truth. Foraſmuch as none of his Eclipſes he takes notice of, are found in any of thoſe five affictitious years which <hi>Herodotus</hi> has clapt to the Reign of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the Firſt. For there is no more than two Ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſes noted in the Reign of <hi>Darius Primus,</hi> one in the twentieth year of his Reign, the other in the thirty firſt. Wherefore whether there were five years more of his Reign or no, <hi>Ptolemy</hi> was little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, he fixing the Obſervations of Eclipſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded no further to the Reign of any <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings than ſo.</p>
               <p>He does indeed take notice of other Eclipſes that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34043:43"/>fell within the Reign of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon</hi> or <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes Secundus,</hi> but he fixes them to the year of no <hi>Perſian</hi> King, but to the <hi>Archons</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> as he finds them ſet down by <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> two while <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtratus</hi> was <hi>Archon</hi> in the year of <hi>Nabonaſſar</hi> 366. another while <hi>Evander</hi> in the year 367.</p>
               <p>Wherefore upon the whole matter, though this Canon of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> makes ſuch a noiſe, eſpecially that of the moſt correct Edition which <hi>Calviſius</hi> has put out, inſerting it in his <hi>Iſagoge;</hi> yet, I think, if one rattle the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Royal Parchments</hi> or Authentick Rolls of the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> in which the <hi>Perſians</hi> by a Law were obliged to record the ancient Acts of their Princes (which <hi>Cteſias Cnidius,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus</hi> takes notice, had the uſe of, living in the quality of a Phyſician in <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemons</hi>'s Court ſeventeen years together, and ſo had the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>accurately</hi> and <hi>particularly</hi> to ſet down every thing) I ſay, if one rattle the Royal Rolls of Parchment againſt the noiſe of <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Canon, I think it may juſtly ſilence the loudneſs thereof, and make any impartial perſon give credit to <hi>Cteſias,</hi> who ſays, <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis</hi> reigned but thirty one years, rather than to <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which pretends he reigned thirty ſix. And yet I will not deny but that <hi>Ptolemy</hi> might adjuſt that Canon as near to the truth as his judgment would reach. For though Aſtronomy may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform us, by virtue of Eclipſes, touching the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the years of <hi>Nabonaſſar,</hi> whether ſuch an Eclipſe in ſuch a year of <hi>Nabonaſſar</hi> be conſiſtent with ſuch an Eclipſe in ſuch a year, at ſuch a diſtance; yet it is Hiſtory only that can adjuſt rightly the endings and beginnings of Kings Reigns within that Interval.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34043:44"/>And therefore notwithſtanding <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s skill in Aſtronomy, he might with the reſt, after <hi>Herodotus,</hi> be involved in that vulgar Errour.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, beſides all this, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Poſtulatum, Cteſias</hi> pronouncing conſonantly to the Divine Oracles, which, as I have above pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we can make no ſenſe of, unleſs the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> be the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks, we are in all reaſon to ſubſcribe to <hi>Cteſias.</hi> For <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy</hi>'s Canon, though it be called <hi>Canon Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> yet it is no <hi>Canonical</hi> Scripture, nor muſt vie with thoſe infallible Oracles of holy Writ.</p>
               <p>It may ſeem a great flaw in Providence to ſome, that the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of a Prophecy of ſo mighty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as this of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks, ſhould be invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ſo much obſcurity and perplexedneſs, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the claſhing of the moſt famous Hiſtories and Records one with another, that are proper for the ſetling of this point. But if we more narrowly and ſeriouſly conſider the matter, this which thus raſhly is accounted a flaw, will prove an argument of a more accurate and punctual Providence of God over the Affairs of his Church, and that he permits no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fall out that would turn ſo much to their detriment, as this is conceived to do. Wherefore, I ſay, there was an egregious uſefulneſs of letting the knowledge of the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo exceeding obſcure and intricate. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, firſt, the Faith and Spirit of diſcernment in the Church had the better ſcope to be exerciſed at the appearance of impoſturous <hi>Meſſias's,</hi> and the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews juſtly left the more obnoxious to thoſe Deluſions.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if the true <hi>Epocha</hi> had been then eaſily
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34043:44"/>diſcoverable by humane helps, it had been ſuch a forcible conviction that Jeſus was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that the Jews could not have had the confidence to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him, or when they had crucified him, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to have acknowledged their miſtake, and been univerſally converted to the Faith, and ſo put abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the ancient Prophecies at a loſs for a true and genuine Interpretation and Impletion.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, Chriſt's offering himſelf to <hi>John</hi> to be baptized in that very nick of time that this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Daniel</hi> points at, numbring the Weeks from the true <hi>Epocha,</hi> no humane helps being then able to diſcover it, leaſt of all any humane Literature of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Carpenters Son, we may be ſure it was by Divine Inſpiration that he came to <hi>John</hi> to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in that year of his Miniſtry that he did, it laſting, as will be proved, about four years together. He was merely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> driven by the Divine Spirit to receive his Baptiſm then. Which conſideration is wanting to that vulgar Opinion that pinches up the Baptiſm of Chriſt into the very firſt year of <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry. But Jeſus being once thus, by the Inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, baptized by <hi>John,</hi> then even from the Prophecy it ſelf he might collect what year he was to ſuffer in, he being in the midſt of that week (which commenced with his Manifeſtation) to make the Jewiſh Sacrifices to ceaſe by the Sacrifice of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Croſs. Which retaining in his memory, that he might not fruſtrate the Prediction, he in a voluntary compliance therewith, ſpoke his preſent mind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. <hi>Go ye up unto this feaſt, I go not up unto this feaſt, for my time is not yet full come.</hi> For he knew the Jews had a mind to kill him, but he would not be killed before his time, but comply
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34043:45"/>with the Prophecy. Wherefore whereas he went after unto the Feaſt, he did it as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, there being after given him an inſpired aſſurance that they ſhould not touch him at that time; as it is ſaid, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Theſe words ſpake Jeſus in the Treaſury as he taught in the Temple, and no man laid hands on him, for his hour was not yet come, viz.</hi> the middle Day of the laſt week of the ſeventy Weeks of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel.</hi> And this I think is enough to vindicate Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from any flaw in permitting ſuch an almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable difficulty for a time to adhere to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks. Which ſame, Providence however, now in this laſt Age wherein the Prophet has predicted that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall abound, has been pleaſed to diſcover with a more perfect underſtanding alſo of the reſt of the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel.</hi>

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:34043:45"/>Tho. Lydiat<hi>'s placing the Nativity of Chriſt two years later than the</hi> Dionyſian <hi>account, than by</hi> Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger<hi>'s placing it two years ſooner, nor ſo much as by</hi> Suſlyga <hi>and</hi> Kepler<hi>'s placing it four or five years ſooner than</hi> Dionyſius.</head>
               <p>BUT having thus clearly and irrefragably made out, that the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes Longimanus</hi> was in the ſecond year of the 77. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 277. of <hi>Nabonaſſar,</hi> and the 4243. of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, whence the twentieth of <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes</hi> (which is the only true and genuine <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks) is found to be in the firſt year of the 82. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and the 296. of <hi>Nabonaſſar,</hi> or the 4262. of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, we are now to take notice what will be the conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> That firſt it will neceſſarily follow, that the laſt year of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks will be in the ſecond year of the 204. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 785. of <hi>Nabonaſſar,</hi> and the 4751. of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, that is to ſay, The Weeks will end in the ſecond year of <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Reign, according to <hi>Helvicus.</hi> Secondly, in virtue of the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which tells us, that the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> by his Sacrifice upon the Croſs, ſhall null the Judaick Sacrifices, and that in the midſt of this laſt Week, preciſely taking it for the middle of the Week, it hence follows, that Chriſt ſuffered in the 4748. year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, that is, in the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year of the Reign of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> And thirdly, partly becauſe the Prophecy ſays he will confirm a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with many this one Week, in the midſt of which he died, whence his own perſonal Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be but three years and an half; and partly, becauſe it is ſaid in the Prophecy, that to <hi>Meſſias</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:34043:46"/>the Prince, <hi>viz.</hi> his Manifeſtation was ſeven weeks and ſixty two, that is to ſay, ſixty nine weeks or 483 years, which 483 years from the <hi>Epocha,</hi> (the Decree which went out the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in the month <hi>Niſan</hi>) reach to the 4745. year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, we are to conclude, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was manifeſted in the nineteenth of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in which year Chriſt was baptized by <hi>John,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt deſcending upon him in the ſhape of a Dove, and a Voice from Heaven ſaying unto him, <hi>Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleaſed,</hi> Luke 3.22.</p>
               <p>This is the Manifeſtation of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> made in the 4745. year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, and in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of the Reign of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> At what time the Evangeliſt, in the forecited place, expreſly ſays, that Jeſus was about thirty years old, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring then upon his Miniſtry. From whence laſtly it follows, if we reckon thirty years backward, that Chriſt was born in the 4716. year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, that is to ſay, in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lucius Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>M. Servilius Geminus,</hi> as <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi> contends he was.</p>
               <p>Theſe things may ſeem Paradoxes to ſuch as have not impartially and carefully conſidered the matter, but they are genuine and neceſſary Confectaries from the admiſſion of that only true <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks the <hi>twentieth</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning his Reign in the ſecond year of the 77. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> not the firſt of the 79. But now if theſe ſeeming Paradoxes, ſhall be alſo in ſeveral countenanced and confirmed by authentick Hiſtory and Reaſon, or both, what can we require more for the certainty, aſſuring us, that this is the true Chronological account of this Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:34043:46"/>and as aſſured an Account as can be had of any thing in Hiſtory and Chronology that ever was put to queſtion.</p>
               <p>Though we went in a Retrograde Order before, we will begin now firſt with the firſt, and propoſe what is ſaid for proof, that Chriſt was born in the Conſulſhip of <hi>L. Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>M.

Which yet is no more Paradoxical than <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s placing it two years ſooner, nor ſo much as <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Suſlyga</hi>'s and <hi>Johannes Kepler</hi>'s their placing it, the one four years, the other five years ſooner than <hi>Dionyſius.</hi> Whence <hi>Tho.

               <p>THE firſt Point is made out thus. Firſt, from the Authority of the moſt ancient Fathers, he proves that Chriſt was born four years before the Death of <hi>Herod.</hi> This <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſays more than once: firſt in theſe words. <hi>Servator in triginta &amp; ſeptem annis principatus ipſius</hi> Herodis <hi>puer erat qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuor annorum, quando</hi> Herodes <hi>impletis annis triginta ſeptem vitam finivit.</hi> And then in another place: <hi>Triceſimo tertio anno</hi> Herodis <hi>naſcitur Chriſtus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus, triceſimo quinto venerunt Magi, triceſimo ſepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo mortuus eſt</hi> Herodes.

But this is a fair Teſtimony of the moſt ancient Fathers, who, one would think, the beſt knew what the Tradition was, nor did any within the firſt 500 years, as <hi>T. L.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, define what year of <hi>Herod</hi> Chriſt was born, but theſe. See the firſt Chapter of his <hi>Recenſio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore the main buſineſs is now to inquire
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34043:47"/>when <hi>Herod</hi> died. And according to the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the above-cited Fathers, if Chriſt was born, <hi>Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>Servilius Geminus</hi> being Conſuls, <hi>Herod</hi> muſt die in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Nerva;</hi> for that is four years after the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Geminus.</hi> And that he died then, firſt is manifeſtly proved out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that tells us more than once, that <hi>Herod,</hi> when he died, was about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years old. And the ſame Author ſays expreſly, that when he was made Prefect of <hi>Galilee</hi> by <hi>Antipater</hi> his Father, <hi>Antiq.

                  </gap>, <hi>when he was extremely young, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving arrived only to fifteen years of Age.</hi> Now this Prefecture was beſtow'd upon him in the year of the Conſulſhip of <hi>Calenus</hi> and <hi>Vatinius,</hi> in which <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> having diſpatch'd the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> War in <hi>Egypt,</hi> made <hi>Antipater,</hi> for his good Service done, Prefect of <hi>Judaea.</hi> Wherefore reckon now in <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicus</hi> all the Conſulates from <hi>Calenus</hi> and <hi>Vatinius</hi> to <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Nerva</hi> incluſively, and you will find them to be fifty four. And whereas <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Herod</hi> was arrived to no more years than fifteen, let us but ſuppoſe him betwixt fifteen and ſixteen (which <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> being the Preterpluperfect tenſe, does plainly imply) when he was made Prefect of <hi>Galilee</hi> by his Father, and add theſe years to the fifty four, and we ſhall come, I trow, very near to ſeventy years. And <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf does not ſay abſolutely that he lived to the ſeventieth year of his Age, but in one place that he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. Jud. lib.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. And <hi>Bell. Jud. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. that he was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>about</hi> the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year, and <hi>near</hi> ſeventy years. And ſo he is,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34043:48"/>I think, that has arrived to the ſixty ninth year of his Age.</p>
               <p>We ſee therefore how well this paſſage of <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſuits with the placing of the Nativity of our Saviour in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Geminus.</hi> Nor is there any evaſion out of this clear proof, that is worth the taking notice of.

               </p>
               <p>But in the mean time it is paſt all doubt with me, that <hi>Herod</hi> was not more than betwixt fifteen and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old, when his Father made him Prefect of <hi>Galilee.</hi> He was, ſuppoſe, in the ſixteenth year of his Age. From whence it follows, that he was not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing twenty two when he was made King of <hi>Judaea</hi> by <hi>M. Antony</hi> and the Senate, which was in the fourth year of the 184. <hi>Olympiad.</hi> And the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this is, that he was not paſſing fifty nine years when he died; his Reign, both according to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> himſelf and the ancient Fathers above-named, being only thirty ſeven years. So that he died in the firſt year of the 194. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and according to the Tradition of thoſe Fathers that ſay, Chriſt was born before <hi>Herod</hi>'s death, Chriſt muſt be born in the firſt year of the 193. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> that is, eight years ſooner than the <hi>Dionyſian</hi> Account has it. Wherefore, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> may not contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who expreſly ſays in more places than one, that <hi>Herod</hi> lived about ſeventy years of Age, nor thoſe Fathers ſpeak ſo extravagantly touching the Nativity of Chriſt, were it not deſirable that there were two <hi>Epocha's</hi> of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign, to ſee if that will not unty this difficult knot? And moſt certainly there is another notorious <hi>Epocha,</hi> when <hi>Herod</hi> having forfeited his Crown and Kingdom, by taking part with <hi>M. Antony</hi> againſt <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> he was created King anew by the favour of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate preſently after the <hi>Victoria Actiaca, viz.</hi> in the ſecond year of the 187. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and in the thirty ſecond year of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Age, according to the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>framed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34043:50"/>Compute out of <hi>Joſephus.</hi> Reckon from this <hi>Epocha,</hi> which is the 4683. of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, to the Conſulate of <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Metellus,</hi> and in that year <hi>Herod</hi>'s ſixty nine years of Age, and thirty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years of his Reign, will end together. And the ancient Fathers Credit, which make Chriſt born four years before <hi>Herod</hi>'s Death, will thus be ſalved, and <hi>Joſephus</hi> made to ſpeak conſiſtently to himſelf, that gives about ſeventy years of Age to <hi>Herod,</hi> but only 37 years to his Reign, though he makes him but betwixt fifteen and ſixteen years old when his Father <hi>Antipater</hi> appointed him Prefect of <hi>Galilee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this happy Hit and handſom Congruity and well According of ſuch claſhing Chronological Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may well alone be an Argument, that this year of the <hi>Victoria Actiaca,</hi> wherein <hi>Auguſtus</hi> did as it were of anew create <hi>Herod</hi> King of <hi>Judaea,</hi> were the <hi>Epocha</hi> of his Reign ever after uſed in his Publick Acts and Records. Which therefore will be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrong proof that <hi>Herod</hi> died in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Nerva,</hi> and conſequently that Chriſt was born four years before in the Conſulſhip of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> and <hi>Geminus,</hi> according to the Doctrine of the above-cited Fathers.</p>
               <p>Certainly if there was ever good occaſion for two ſeveral <hi>Epocha's</hi> of one King's Reign, it was here. For <hi>Herod</hi> having forfeited his Crown and Life too, to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> by his ſiding with <hi>M. Antony</hi> againſt him, and there being a new Creation, as it were, of <hi>Herod,</hi> and reſtoring of him to the Crown, what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſion can there be given than this (he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as it were, the World again upon a new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) for a new <hi>Epocha</hi> of his Reign. This was a more ſurprizing Change than <hi>Soſius</hi> his taking <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:34043:50"/>and <hi>Antonius</hi> his ſlaying of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that the Kingdom might be made more ſure to <hi>Herod,</hi> who was made King by the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate four years before; and yet <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf, <hi>Antiq. Jud. lib.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. makes his getting poſſeſſion of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and ſlaughter of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> which <hi>Herod</hi> procured, one <hi>Epocha</hi> of his Reign, expreſly there affirming, that the Fight at <hi>Actium</hi> betwixt <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> was in the ſeventh year of <hi>Herod,</hi> which is down-right falſe, unleſs you number from that later <hi>Epocha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well therefore may this reſtitution of <hi>Herod</hi> to his Crown, after he had forfeited all, become the more ſolemn <hi>Epocha</hi> of the years of his Reign; and well may he be thought to affect that <hi>Epocha,</hi> the more to ingratiate himſelf with his great Patron <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſignifying thereby, that only <hi>now</hi> at length he was rightfully King, ſince he received his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> the ſole legitimate Prince of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Whenas on the other ſide, if he had continued to reckon his Reign from the time he was made King by the favour of <hi>M. Antony, Auguſtus</hi> his Enemy, he might ſtill ſeem to favour the Cauſe of <hi>Antonius,</hi> and inſinuate <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his War againſt him to have been unjuſt, and ſoil the Glory of the <hi>Actiacal</hi> Victory. That alſo he might pleaſe himſelf in, and applaud his Politick modeſty, that he would not have his Reign to commence higher than the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> which began with the <hi>Actia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Victory. And certainly he would think it a piece of impudence in himſelf, if he ſhould have ſuffered <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſpeaks, a day of Inauguration into his Kingdom, which was annually ſolemnized by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34043:51"/>him to be done in Honour to <hi>M. Antony,</hi> and not ſolely to <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Whence it will naturally follow, that it was in reference to the time that he was made King by <hi>him,</hi> and ſo this became a moſt celebrated <hi>Epocha.</hi> This is highly credible, if not neceſſary and certain, if we conſider how <hi>Herod</hi> did all things with all the ſtudiouſneſs imaginable to get and keep the favour of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> adventuring rather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon the Sacred cuſtoms of his Religion, than to omit any thing whereby to curry favour with that Emperour, that gave him, after the Forfeiture, both his Life and Crown at once. And laſtly, others may add to all this, <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> who had an heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Right to the Crown, being at the ſame time taken out of the way, this <hi>Epocha</hi> upon that account alſo is moſt perfect and moſt proper.</p>
               <p>And now as this is moſt reaſonable in it ſelf, ſo Authors are found to begin the Reign of <hi>Herod</hi> from this <hi>Epocha,</hi> as well as from his being made King by <hi>M.

               <p>And thirdly and laſtly, The ancient <hi>Graeci Faſti,</hi> as <hi>T.

Mulerius, <hi>and found rather bigger than what</hi> T. L. <hi>declares it. The groſs abſurdity of making the</hi> ſeventh <hi>of</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>the</hi> Epocha <hi>of</hi> Daniel<hi>'s Weeks, it implying that Chriſt was baptized by</hi> John, <hi>before the Baptiſt enired on his Miniſtry.</hi> Lydiat<hi>'s Eclipſe compared with</hi> Petavius<hi>'s; as alſo with the Eclipſes of the</hi> 4711, 4712, <hi>and</hi> 4713 <hi>years of the</hi> I.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34043:53"/>ineptneſs thereof diſcovered. And therefore</hi> Herod <hi>dying in the year of</hi> Lydiat<hi>'s Eclipſe, Chriſt muſt be born,</hi> Lamia <hi>and</hi> Geminus <hi>being Conſuls.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THAT <hi>Herod</hi> died in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi> and <hi>Nerva,</hi> which is the 52. <hi>Julian</hi> year, or the 4720. of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, is proved thus. <hi>Archelaus</hi> enjoyed his Ethnarchy of <hi>Judaea</hi> after his Father <hi>Herod</hi>'s death, nine years and better, as is manifeſt out of <hi>Joſephus, Euſebius, Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Sulpicius Severus.</hi> But the ſaid <hi>Archelaus,</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Relegation, married <hi>Glaphyra,</hi> the Widow of <hi>Juba,</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> twice teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies. Whence, till <hi>Juba</hi>'s death, the Exile of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaus</hi> could not be. But <hi>Tho. Lydiat</hi> makes it good out of <hi>Strabo,</hi> that <hi>Juba</hi> was alive in the firſt, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or the ſecond year of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> or if you will, in the Conſulate of <hi>Statilius Taurus</hi> and <hi>Scribonius Libo.</hi> Before that time <hi>Archelaus</hi> was not baniſhed. Wherefore he not reigning above nine years and a little more, if we reckon to the ninth Conſulate from this backward, we ſhall fall into that of <hi>M. Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Camillus</hi> and <hi>Sext. Non. Quintilianus,</hi> into which the firſt year of <hi>Archelaus</hi> his Reign reaches, and which immediately the Conſulate of <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Nerva</hi> precedes: And in which therefore <hi>Herod</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. See <hi>T. L.</hi> his <hi>Recenſio, cap.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Dion Caſſius</hi> in his <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory in the year of <hi>Aemylius Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Lucius Aruntius</hi> Conſuls, writes thus. <hi>Herodes Palaeſtinus,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, being accuſed by his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, was baniſhed beyond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and part of his Dition laid to the Publick. <hi>Dion</hi> indeed here, either for brevity ſake, or out of ignorance, joyns
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34043:53"/>the Baniſhment of theſe Brethren cloſe to their impleading one another before <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> preſently upon their Father <hi>Herod</hi>'s death; but in that he makes this impleading, which is at large deſcribed in <hi>Joſephus, Antiq. Jud. lib.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. in the year of <hi>Aemylius Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Lucius Aruntius;</hi> this joyns it very near to the time of <hi>Herod</hi>'s death, which we contend for. For the Conſulate of <hi>Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> immediately precedes that of <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Nerva.</hi> So that from this otherwiſe confuſed paſſage, there is ſome glimmerings of this great Truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, <hi>Antiq. Jud. lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. that <hi>Quirinius,</hi> in execution of the Tax that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on, in the 37. year after <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Victory over <hi>M. Antony</hi> at <hi>Actium,</hi> ſold and confiſcated the Goods of <hi>Archelaus.</hi> Now, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> notes in his Life, <hi>cap.</hi> 27. <hi>Cenſum populi ter egit</hi> Auguſtus, <hi>primum &amp; tertium cum Collega, medium ſolus.</hi> This <hi>Collega</hi> or Yoke-fellow in Office was <hi>Tiberius</hi> in the third Tax, which muſt neceſſarily be here meant, <hi>Herod</hi> being alive in the two former. But this third was even in the very cloſe of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his days, who died, <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> and <hi>Sextus Apuleius</hi> being Conſuls: But as <hi>T. L.</hi> makes out by Hiſtory (ſee his <hi>Recenſio, cap.</hi> 15.) was executed in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Statilius Taurus</hi> and <hi>Scribonius Libo.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Quirinius</hi> confiſcating <hi>Archelaus</hi> his Goods in that year, it is an Argument that then was the time of his Relega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a matter of nine or ten years from the Conſulſhip of <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Metellus:</hi> whence again it is manifeſt, that <hi>Herod</hi> died when they two were Conſuls. It's true, here <hi>Joſephus</hi> makes this Tax to be in the 37. year of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Monarchy, which is a contradiction to the time of this third Tax; but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34043:54"/>it is a mere <hi>Parachroniſmus,</hi> or rather <hi>Parepochiſmus,</hi> the taking one <hi>Epocha</hi> for another, that of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Monarchical Reign, the <hi>Actiaca Victoria,</hi> for the time of his accepting of the Sacroſanct and abſolute Sovereign <hi>Tribunitian</hi> Power, which was not till nine years after the <hi>Victoria Actiaca;</hi> namely, when himſelf was the eleventh time Conſul. Take but that <hi>Epocha,</hi> and all runs ſmooth; but without it, this paſſage of <hi>Joſephus</hi> is a contradiction to it ſelf. And yet this paſſage, compared with the ſtory of <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyra,</hi> does notably confirm the true time of <hi>Herod</hi>'s death, that it was in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Nerva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Joſephus</hi> in the ſame eighteenth Book, Chap. 6. tells, that <hi>Philippus</hi> the Tetrarch died the 37. year of his Reign, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, where <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> an ancient Interpreter of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> aſcribing to <hi>Philip</hi> the Tetrarch thirty two years, does fairly inſinuate, that we ſhould read in the Greek Copy, not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but rather <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>thirty one years, viz.</hi> thirty one years current. Now, as <hi>T. L.</hi> affirms, and <hi>Helvicus</hi> alſo conſents thereto, <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> died in the ſame year, <hi>viz. Proculus</hi> and <hi>Nigrinus</hi> being Conſuls: in which very year <hi>Petavius</hi> places the death of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi> Number therefore thirty one years from <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> and <hi>Nigrinus,</hi> and they will end in the Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Metellus,</hi> in which we contend that <hi>Herod,</hi> the Father of <hi>Philip,</hi> died.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>Chronicon, Num.</hi> MM XXX. and <hi>Sulpicius Severus, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Hiſtor. Sacr.</hi> give twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four years to <hi>Herod</hi> the Tetrarch after the Rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Archelaus.</hi> Now <hi>Joſephus, Antiq. Jud. lib.</hi> 19. in the laſt Chapter, making out the ſeven years
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34043:54"/>of <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s Reign, writes thus. Four years, ſays he, he reigned in <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi>'s time, three years of which he enjoyed the Tetrarchy of <hi>Philip,</hi> but in the fourth year there was added to him the Tetrarchy of <hi>Herod,</hi> and three years more he reigned in the time of <hi>Claudius Caeſar.</hi> Whence it is manifeſt, from this exquiſite and punctual account of theſe ſeven years Reign of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that <hi>Herod</hi> the Tetrarch's Reign ended with the fourth year of <hi>Caius Caligula.</hi> From which year, reckoning the 24 years of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign after the Exile of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nine or ten years of <hi>Archelaus</hi> his Reign after his Father <hi>Herod</hi>'s death, and it will reach to the Conſulate of <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Nerva,</hi> at what time <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> the Son of <hi>Antipater,</hi> died.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and laſtly, For a further confirmation of this Truth, that <hi>Herod</hi> died in the Conſulate of <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Nerva,</hi> let us add that notable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>T. L.</hi> draws from the Eclipſe that <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> takes notice of, as happening a little before <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s death. And it is worth the obſerving, that it is the only Eclipſe which that Hiſtorian has ſet down in all his Hiſtory. Which argues not only the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of its appearing, but the extraordinary greatneſs thereof, elſe it had not ſtuck in the minds of the Beholders ſo firmly, that the Fame thereof might cauſe <hi>Joſephus</hi> to record it, when he records none beſides. The Narrative is briefly this, <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. There he tells us, that <hi>Herod</hi> being deſperately ill, beyond all hope of Recovery (which cauſed ſome Zelots for the Law to pull down the golden Eagle which <hi>Herod</hi> had erected over the greater Gate of the Temple; of which bold Feat the two <hi>Matthias</hi>'s were, the one ſuſpected, the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34043:55"/>other found guilty) <hi>Herod,</hi> ſays he, depriving <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> the High-Prieſt of his High-Prieſthood, he burnt the other <hi>Matthias,</hi> who was the Author of the Sedition, together with <hi>Judas</hi> and other of his <hi>Accomplices</hi> alive, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and the Moon that very ſame night</hi> in which they were burnt, <hi>ſuffered an Eclipſe.</hi> For it naturally implies that they were burnt that night, as well as the Moon was then Eclipſed. Now for the time of year when this Eclipſe happened, it is plainly ſet down in the eleventh Chapter, that it was the Full Moon imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceding the Full Moon at which they keep their Paſſeover, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt Full Moon of their month <hi>Abib</hi> or <hi>Niſan:</hi> ſo that <hi>Herod</hi> died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a month after he had burned <hi>Matthias</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and other Confederates, in pulling down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhing the golden Eagle that he had dedicated and ſet up over the great Gate of the Temple. Nor can any one that will impartially conſider the nature of theſe things that are ſaid to be done by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, while alive, or by others after his death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe two Full Moons; and the ſcantneſs of the Country of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and the ſmalneſs of the time requiſite for the doing of them, but he muſt needs conceive that <hi>Herod</hi> died betwixt theſe two Full Moons, the <hi>Eclipſed</hi> one and <hi>Paſchal,</hi> elſe they muſt protract his life near to the next <hi>Paſchal</hi> Moon, and make him live in a manner a whole year longer, which is hugely diſſonant from the Narrative of <hi>Joſephus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that there was ſuch an huge Eclipſe, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at ſuch a ſeaſon of the year, but at a fit time of the night, when mens ſpirits were more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily awakened in an hurry upon the burning
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34043:55"/>thoſe Zelots for their Law, who haply might be brought out to be burnt about ſeven or eight a clock of the Night (as <hi>Nero</hi> is ſaid to have burned the Chriſtians in the night-ſeaſon) <hi>T. L.</hi> does make good by Aſtronomical Calculation, that ſuch an Eclipſe ſo circumſtantiated, did happen in the year when <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Metellus</hi> were Conſuls: which is the third year of the 196. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and the 52. <hi>Julian</hi> Year, and the 4720. Year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, <hi>viz.</hi> when <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi> and <hi>Nerva</hi> were Conſuls, according to <hi>Helvieus</hi> and <hi>Petavius,</hi> as well as <hi>T. L.</hi> And this year <hi>T. L.</hi> in his <hi>Recenſio</hi> finds by Compute, <hi>Primâ vigiliâ Noctis inſecutae viceſimum diem Februarii medium Plenilunium contigiſſe unâ &amp; viginti horis, ac quinquaginta quin<expan>

And this <hi>Plenilunium</hi> happening <hi>unâ &amp; viginti horis, ac quinquaginta quin<expan>

                     </expan> ſcrupulis,</hi> &amp;c. that is, at 55 minutes after nine a clock at Night; it is plain the middle of the Eclipſe fell not within the <hi>Vigilia prima,</hi> but its beginning might fall within it, even within the ſecond hour of the <hi>prima Vigilia,</hi> 55 minutes after ſeven; the Moon being eclipſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Computation above 18 digits, and the Eclipſe continuing near two hours, and ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly obſcured, and ſo wading in the ſhade of the Earth more than three quarters of an hour together. This is a remarkable Eclipſe, and would, eſpecially falling out at ſuch a time, ſtick in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of the Beholders, and they tranſmit it to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. And now there being no ſuch Eclipſe to be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34043:56"/>found ſo ſuited for greatneſs and ſeaſonableneſs in any year they would pitch upon for the death of <hi>Herod,</hi> that would deduce the Weeks of <hi>Daniel</hi> from the <hi>ſeventh</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Reign: this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, is a fair demonſtration that they have choſen a wrong <hi>Epocha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth of this is ſo material, that I had the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, and gave my ſelf the trouble of calculating this Eclipſe of the Moon that fell out in the Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Metellus, Anno Periodi Julianae</hi> 4720, by more Tables than one, by the <hi>Copernican</hi> Tables, the <hi>Alfonſine</hi> and <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> Tables, as <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus Muſerius,</hi> that excellent Aſtronomo Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger, and highly valued both by <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> (though at odds betwixt themſelves) has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted them for this uſe, and find by them all that the Eclipſe is rather greater than <hi>T. L.</hi> has computed. According to the <hi>Alfonſine</hi> Tables, the Moon was Eclipſed digits 19. ⅞; according to the <hi>Copernican</hi> and <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> Tables, 21 digits at leaſt. According to them all, the duration of her Eclipſe was above four hours, and her ſtay within the ſhadow of the Earth totally obſcured two hours, bating ſome few minutes. Whence in all likelihood it was a moſt terrible and diſmal Eclipſe, and ſuch as would make an indeleble impreſſion on the phancy of them that beheld it. But now as for the beginning of the Eclipſe, according to the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> Tables, it was a little after ten of the Clock at night. According to the <hi>Alfonſine</hi> a little before nine; and according to the <hi>Copernican,</hi> about half an hour after nine. The lateſt of which times is ſoon enough to engage the Spectators eyes to behold it, the Zelots being burnt in the ſame Night, and haply not ſooner than
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34043:56"/>betwixt ſeven and eight of the Clock, and people would be abroad after that hurry longer than the lateſt beginning of this Eclipſe.</p>
               <p>We ſhall underſtand the appoſiteneſs of this Eclipſe for the purpoſe the better, if we compare it with the Eclipſe that <hi>Petavius</hi> takes notice of <hi>Anno P. I.</hi> 4710. in which year, according to <hi>Joſephus</hi> his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>Herod</hi> died. For then reckoning from <hi>Anno P. I.</hi> 4674. as the firſt year of his Reign, upon his being made King of <hi>Judaea,</hi> by the Favour of <hi>Antony</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, he will have reigned thirty ſeven years. And now becauſe I was mentioning the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Week from the ſeventh year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> which is the year of <hi>P. I.</hi> 4256. this being made the <hi>Epocha,</hi> the laſt year of the weeks will be <hi>Anno P. I.</hi> 4745. Now therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as the Prophecy will naturally caſt us upon it, reckoning backwards from the year 4745. (which is the nineteenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and the laſt year of the ſeventieth week) to the Paſſion of Chriſt, who in the midſt of this week put an end to the Judaical Sacrifices by his own Sacrifice on the Croſs, and we come to the ſixteenth year of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> And the other half of this laſt week will reach to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> the year of Chriſt's Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation and Baptiſm by <hi>John,</hi> which is two years before <hi>John</hi>'s preaching, who began to preach the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as the Goſpel tells us; as alſo that Chriſt was not baptized by <hi>John,</hi> till after he had begun his preaching. Which therefore is an horrible flaw in this <hi>Epocha</hi> from the ſeventh of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Chriſt was baptized by <hi>John,</hi> he was about thirty years of <hi>Age,</hi> ſuppoſe him going on his one
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34043:57"/>and thirty, it will then follow, that he was born <hi>Anno P. I.</hi> 4709. the year before the death of <hi>Herod,</hi> as <hi>Petavius</hi> has alſo noted. Now beſides the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of this ſeventh of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> being the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks, in that it makes Chriſt to be baptized by <hi>John</hi> before he began his preaching, which was in the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and alſo the very little diſtance betwixt Chriſt's Birth and <hi>Herod</hi>'s Death, this Eclipſe noted by <hi>Petavius</hi> at the death of <hi>Herod, Sabinus</hi> and <hi>Rufus</hi> being Conſuls, is a pitiful ſmall buſineſs, and unſuitable, if compared with that Eclipſe which happened in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Metellus.</hi> For calculating that Eclipſe, which <hi>Petavius</hi> mentions, which I did, before I met with it in <hi>Petavius,</hi> I computed it, as he has done, to have been <hi>Martii</hi> XIII. <hi>Hor.</hi> 2. <hi>à media nocte,</hi> but we differ in minutes, he ſays 45 minutes, but my Compute has only 23, which is more favourable to him than his own. And yet according to my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the Eclipſe began not till near one of the Clock in the Morning. According to his, it would be at paſt one. But that which he conceals, the Moon was then Eclipſed but about ſix digits and ¾. But what is ſeven digits to thrice ſeven, or 21 digits, or indeed to 20? And then it beginning not till one a Clock in the Morning, it was not likely to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, or to be talked of, ſuch little Eclipſes being ordinary. Nor is it credible, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> taking no notice in all his Hiſtory of any Eclipſes but this, that he would have recorded this, but that it was ſo notorious, and ſo much talked of amongſt the people for the hugeneſs and diſmalneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Nor can thoſe that make the <hi>ſeventh</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:34043:57"/>the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Weeks, ſet the death of <hi>Herod</hi> at a more probable diſtance from the Birth of Chriſt, both becauſe that they would then deſert the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and that they are alſo deſtitute of an Eclipſe for the purpoſe. For in the year 4711. <hi>P. J.</hi> there are indeed two Ecliptical <hi>Plenilunium medium</hi>'s, the one in <hi>March,</hi> the other in <hi>July;</hi> but both of them not paſſing two or three degrees within the <hi>Termini Ecliptici:</hi> ſo that they will prove miſerable megre Eclipſes, if any at all. And in the 4712. there I meet with but one Eclipſe, and that in <hi>Jul.</hi> 16. much more conſiderable for bigneſs, but at too great a diſtance from the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Moon enſuing. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this <hi>Plenilunium verum</hi> happens at <hi>Leowardia</hi> at ſeven a Clock 12 minutes paſt Midnight; but at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at nine a Clock 48 minutes <hi>à media nocte,</hi> that is, within a very little of ten a Clock in the Morning; and therefore not poſſible to be ſeen by the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but rather by their <hi>Antipodes.</hi> In the Year 4713. <hi>Cornelius Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Calphurnius Piſo</hi> being Conſuls, there is indeed an Eclipſe <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. that for bigneſs may compare with that under <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Metellus,</hi> but not for ſeaſonableneſs. For it is neither the immediately preceding <hi>Plenilunium</hi> to the <hi>Paſchal;</hi> and being ſo in the Winter, it ill ſuits with <hi>Herod</hi>'s being adviſed by his Phyſicians to make uſe of the Waters of <hi>Callir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoe</hi> beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> and the beginning of it is not till after twelve a Clock at Night, when people are gone to bed. And in the ſame year on the ſixth of <hi>July,</hi> there is a conſiderable Eclipſe; but it falling out near Noon-time at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it is plain it is little to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Eclipſes of theſe four years of the <hi>Julian</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34043:58"/>I have conſidered, becauſe the ancient Fathers relate that <hi>Herod</hi> lived four years after the Birth of Chriſt, and we ſee that in all the Eclipſes that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened after the Birth of Chriſt, fixt in the Year 4709. <hi>P. J.</hi> (where they muſt fix it that make the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks the ſeventh of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>) till the Year 4713. which is the fourth after the Birth of Chriſt ſo fixed; that there is none that can ſtand in competition with that Eclipſe that happened <hi>Anno P. J.</hi> 4720. <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Metellus</hi> being Conſuls. The moſt plauſible is that of <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. <hi>Cornelius Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Calphurnius Piſo</hi> being Conſuls. But beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incongruities in it, which I noted before, though it be removed enough to be the fourth year after Chriſt's Nativity, according to the Opinion of the ancient Fathers, yet it is removed too much from the end of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign, from his being conſtituted King by the Favour of <hi>M. Antony</hi> and the Senate. For his thirty ſeven years of reigning expire in the 4710. year <hi>P. J.</hi> and this makes him live three years after. Which nulls the Authority of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> on which they build, and thwarts the Current of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. Wherefore it is an invincible Argument from the Eclipſe in the Conſulate of <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Metellus,</hi> that <hi>Herod</hi> died that year, and that Chriſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Opinion of the ancient Fathers, was born four years before in the Conſulate of <hi>L. Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>M. Servilius Geminus:</hi> which was the thing to be proved.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. Joſephus <hi>his inconſiſteney with himſelf in matters of Chronologie. The firſt Objection taken out of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in him againſt</hi> Herod<hi>'s dying</hi> Metellus <hi>and</hi> Nerva <hi>being Conſuls, that plainly imply that he reigned but thirty ſeven years in all, and that from his firſt being made King by the favour of</hi> M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony. <hi>The ſecond Objection from</hi> Antipater <hi>'s ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Children to the King of</hi> Arabia, <hi>when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his War with</hi> Ariſtobulus: <hi>which was in the firſt year of the</hi> 178. <hi>Olympiad. Whence</hi> Herod <hi>is concluded twenty five years old when he was made Prefect of</hi> Galilee. <hi>In order to an Anſwer, two aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured parcels of</hi> Joſephus <hi>his</hi> Materia Hiſtorica <hi>are premiſed. The firſt, that</hi> Herod <hi>was but fifteen years old when he was made Prefect of</hi> Galilee, <hi>ſeveral other paſſages in</hi> Joſephus <hi>complying therewith. The ſecond, that he was about ſeventy years of Age, and had reigned but thirty ſeven when he dyed. No occaſion for</hi> Joſephus <hi>to miſtake in the former par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, but a very obvious one in the latter. That none of the five Children mentioned in the ſecond Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, were thoſe ſent to the King of</hi> Arabia. <hi>That it is a contradiction to what</hi> Joſephus <hi>elſewhere ſays of</hi> Phaſaelus <hi>and</hi> Herod. <hi>If</hi> Joſephus <hi>meant thoſe five, that it is upon his having committed a</hi> Parepochiſm, <hi>to which his ſecond Hiſtorical Parcel lay obnoxious. Whence his Teſtimony to his firſt parcel preponderates that to the ſecond, and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy with the time of Chriſt's Baptiſm and true</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:34043:59"/>Epocha <hi>of</hi> Daniel<hi>'s Weeks, demonſtrates him to have miſſed the right</hi> Epocha <hi>of</hi> Herod<hi>'s Reign: which with eaſe reconciles all theſe claſhings.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AND thus we have ſeen with what firmneſs and ſteadineſs this Demonſtration has been carried on for the fixing of Chriſt's Nativity in the Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Geminus,</hi> if Hiſtorians themſelves were ſo firm and fixt; or rather ſo conſiſtent in their Aſſertions, as not to ſpeak repugnantly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This I ſpeak in reference to <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who makes <hi>Herod</hi> but fifteen years old when <hi>Antipater</hi> made him Prefect of <hi>Galilee:</hi> And he makes him reign but thirty ſeven years from his being made King by <hi>M. Antony</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, and yet to have reached to be about ſeventy years of Age.</p>
               <p>This therefore is one of the two great Objections which is brought againſt <hi>Herod</hi>'s dying in the year of <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Nerva,</hi> and that notable Eclipſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove taken notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Joſephus, Antiq. Jud. lib.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. expreſly declares, that <hi>Herod</hi> in that deſperate ſickneſs of which he died, was upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years of Age, which he repeats again <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. <hi>De Bello Judaico.</hi> And yet <hi>Antiq.

                  </gap>. From which places it is collected, that though <hi>Herod</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:34043:59"/>was about ſeventy years of Age when he died, yet he reigned but thirty ſeven years from the time that he was declared King of <hi>Judaea</hi> by the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the procurement of <hi>M. Antony,</hi> and not from that time that the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> made him King upon the Forfeiture of his Kingdom, becauſe it is ſaid in both places, that it was thirty four years from the death of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> as well as thirty ſeven from his being made King by the Favour of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Senate; for that is underſtood by <hi>Romans</hi> in theſe places, and there is three years diſtance betwixt <hi>Antigonus</hi> his death and that. Whence, ſay they, it is manifeſt, that <hi>Herod</hi> did not die in the Year 4720. <hi>P. J. Metellus</hi> and <hi>Nerva</hi> being Conſuls, but in the Year 4710. in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Sabinus</hi> and <hi>Rufus;</hi> and that <hi>Herod</hi> was not fifteen years of Age when he was made Prefect of <hi>Galilee</hi> by his Father <hi>Antipater,</hi> but twenty five.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Objection, or rather the Confirmation of this former, is taken out of <hi>Joſephus, Antiq.

               </p>
               <p>We are now to inquire when this War begun, which we ſhall underſtand out of <hi>Joſephus, Antiq. Jud. lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. where he tells us, that <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> was inveſted in his Pontificate or High-Prieſthood the third year of the 177. <hi>Olympiad, Q. Hortenſius</hi> and <hi>Q. Metellus</hi> being Conſuls; it is rather the fourth year of that Olympiad, <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Hortenſius</hi> being Conſuls then, according to both <hi>Helvicus</hi> and <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> and <hi>Lydiat</hi> too. But preſently upon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing High-Prieſt, his Brother <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> makes War againſt him, and at a Battel at <hi>Jericho</hi> puts him to flight, and that very year conſtrained him to lay down his High-Prieſthood, and betake himſelf to a private life. When <hi>Antipater</hi> ſaw this, he never ceaſed from ſoliciting <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> to recover his Right, but within a years time, ſuppoſe, or thereabout, perſwaded him to fly to <hi>Aretas</hi> King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> in whom he had a great intereſt, which in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, according to <hi>Joſephus</hi> his account, was done in the firſt year of the 178. <hi>Olympiad.</hi> And here <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater</hi> undertaking the War againſt <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> with the aid of <hi>Aretas,</hi> this muſt be the time of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying his five Children to his Court for ſafety. At what time it cannot be conceived but that <hi>Herod</hi> was at leaſt three years old, <hi>Salome</hi> being the fourth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34043:60"/>from him: Let him be going on his fourth. From this firſt year of the 178. <hi>Olympiad</hi> to the Conſulſhip of <hi>Calenus</hi> and <hi>Vatinius,</hi> when <hi>Herod</hi> was made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>Galilee,</hi> is twenty two years: add the three years complete when <hi>Herod</hi> was with the reſt of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater</hi>'s Children ſent to the King of <hi>Arabia;</hi> and then it will follow, that <hi>Herod</hi> was twenty five years old when he was made Prefect of <hi>Galilee.</hi> And ſo <hi>Herod</hi> muſt have died <hi>Anno P. J.</hi> 4710. not 4720. <hi>viz.</hi> in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Metellus.</hi> Theſe are the moſt ſhrewd Objections that I can pick out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and I have ſet them off to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage I could.</p>
               <p>But now in order to the anſwering of theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, I ſhall firſt premiſe, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> took theſe two things for certain and aſſured Parcels of his <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Materials, viz.</hi> (1.) That <hi>Herod,</hi> when his Father made him Prefect of <hi>Galilee,</hi> was not more years than fifteen complete. That there is no lapſe of the Scribe in this Compute, but that it is ſet down according to <hi>Joſephus</hi> his own mind, I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. And the matter is ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, that <hi>Petavius</hi> himſelf does acknowledge it no lapſe of the Scribe, but that <hi>Joſephus</hi> in that place wrote as he thought, <hi>De doctrina Temp. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 65. And how conſentaneous to this Poſition his ſtory of <hi>Glaphyra</hi> is, and his making <hi>Quirinius</hi> to confiſcate the Goods of <hi>Archelaus</hi> in the year when <hi>Statilius Taurus</hi> and <hi>Scribonius Libo</hi> were Conſuls, as alſo the making <hi>Herod</hi> the Tetrarch's Reign end with the fourth year of <hi>Caligula;</hi> and laſtly, his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of the Eclipſe that happened in the year of <hi>Herod</hi>'s death, I have obſerved in the foregoing Chapter. To which I will only add how conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34043:61"/>to this is <hi>Joſephus</hi> his calling <hi>Phaſaelus</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> (<hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 23.) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Adoleſcentuli,</hi> when <hi>M. Antony</hi> made them Tetrarchs of <hi>Judaea.</hi> But if <hi>Herod</hi> was twenty five years old when he was made Prefect of <hi>Galilee,</hi> he was above thirty now, and his Brother <hi>Phaſaelus</hi> haply betwixt thirty and forty, both of them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Account, the utmoſt bounds of their <hi>Adoleſcentia</hi> being but twenty ſeven years. After that, they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as you may ſee in <hi>Xenophon.</hi> And yet here <hi>Phaſaelus</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> the one betwixt thirty and forty years of Age, the other a year or two above thirty, are not only called <hi>Adoleſcentes,</hi> but <hi>Adoleſcentuli.</hi> Wherefore that they are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Adoleſcentuli,</hi> is plainly conſequential to this aſſured Parcel of <hi>Joſephus</hi> his <hi>Hiſtorical Materials;</hi> That <hi>Herod,</hi> when he was made Prefect of <hi>Galilee,</hi> was but about fifteen years of Age.</p>
               <p>And the other aſſured Parcel of his <hi>Materia Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> was this, That <hi>Herod</hi> was about ſeventy years of Age when he died, and that he reigned thirty ſeven years. This he was aſcertained of by ſome Records that he had met with and could confide in. Nor is there with me any queſtion made, but that both theſe parcels of his <hi>Materia Hiſtorica</hi> are true. But that he reckons the thirty ſeven years of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign from his firſt being made King by the Favour of <hi>M. Antony</hi> and the Senate: I deny that he had any Authentick Record for that, but I deem it a mere ſurmiſe of his own. Wherefore going no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the preſent, but weighing the Teſtimony of <hi>Joſephus</hi> in one place with his Teſtimony in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I anſwer thus;</p>
               <p>That his Aſſertion, that <hi>Herod</hi> was but fifteen years
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34043:61"/>old when he was Prefect of <hi>Galilee,</hi> is the Aſſertion of ſuch a thing in which there is no occaſion or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement to err in; nor is it credible he would ever have writ ſo, it ſeeming ſo unplauſible a thing in it ſelf, that the Government of a Country ſhould be committed to one ſo extremely young, unleſs he had found it amongſt the aſſured Materials of his Hiſtory. But now for the other aſſured parcel of his Hiſtorical Matter, <hi>Herod</hi>'s dying at ſeventy years of Age, and reigning but thirty ſeven: here <hi>Joſephus</hi> might well find himſelf <hi>in Bivio</hi> as it were; and the way fork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf into two Roads, that which ſeemed the more fair and direct, he might be tempted preſently to take it, though he miſtook himſelf in it. I ſpeak this in reference to the two <hi>Epocha's</hi> of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign, the one when he was made King of <hi>Judaea</hi> by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>M. Antony,</hi> the other when by the Favour of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> The former, as being firſt, is the more naturally enticing to be made choice of, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Joſephus</hi> out of over-much inadvertence or beed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs adventured upon, and ſo fairly committed a <hi>Parepochiſm,</hi> the taking one <hi>Epocha</hi> for another. Now the matter of his other Aſſertion being not liable to any ſuch miſtake, it is plain the Teſtimony of <hi>Joſephus</hi> in that point is to preponderate his Teſtimony in this, or in any thing elſe that depends upon it. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, One Abſurdity admitted, others will follow.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the anſwering the ſecond Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I ſhall premiſe, That it is not probable, at leaſt we have no aſſurance, that thoſe five, namely, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaelus, Herod, Joſephus, Pheroras</hi> and <hi>Salome,</hi> were <hi>all</hi> the Children that <hi>Antipater</hi> had by <hi>Cypris,</hi> becauſe there is none of theſe but make part of his Hiſtory;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34043:62"/>but there might be in all likelihood other Children that died when they were Children, and ſo left no memory behind them. And furthermore add, that it is no ſuch extraordinary thing for a man to have more than twice as many Children of one Wife, as <hi>Herod</hi> had of his.</p>
               <p>Whence therefore I anſwer firſt, That though this Argument looks very plauſible on it, it ſo fitting their conceit that would have <hi>Herod</hi> twenty five years old (as <hi>Petavius,</hi> amongſt others, would have him) when he was made Prefect of <hi>Galilee;</hi> yet there is no firmneſs nor certainty in it. For <hi>Joſephus</hi> in the place above-cited does not ſay, that thoſe very five Children were committed to the Truſt of the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which he names a little before (every one of them acting a part in his Hiſtory) but to ſhow how gracious <hi>Antipater</hi> was with the great ones of <hi>Arabia,</hi> as well as of <hi>Idumaea,</hi> and the ſure Friendſhip and Confidence betwixt the King of <hi>Arabia</hi> and him, he ſays he depoſited his Children with him when he began his War againſt <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> whether theſe or others, more or leſs, there is no mention thereof. Wherefore for any thing this place will prove to the contrary, they might be two or three Children that <hi>Antipater</hi> depoſited with <hi>Aretas,</hi> before <hi>Phaſaelus,</hi> or any of the other four mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were born.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That theſe five ſhould be the Children, and ſo <hi>Herod</hi> be twenty five years of Age when he was made Prefect of <hi>Galilee,</hi> it will make him above thirty when <hi>M. Antony</hi> made him Tetrarch of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea:</hi> at what time notwithſtanding <hi>Joſephus</hi> calls him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Adoleſcentulus,</hi> a Stripling, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:34043:62"/>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, If <hi>Joſephus</hi> meant theſe five to be the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the dear <hi>Depoſitum</hi> with the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> it is then upon his ſurmiſe that the thirty ſeven years of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign are to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred from the firſt <hi>Epocha;</hi> but there being only the Teſtimony of <hi>Joſephus</hi> for that againſt <hi>Joſephus</hi> in a matter leſs liable to miſtake, this latter Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Joſephus</hi> is to be preferred before his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or any thing elſe that depends thereon, as I noted before. And thus we ſee that appealing to the mere humane Authority of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf plainly prevails againſt that Teſtimony of his that would diſprove our fixing the Nativity of Chriſt to the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Geminus,</hi> and the Death of <hi>Herod</hi> to that of <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Metellus.</hi> How infinitely then muſt it prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate when the Divine Teſtimony is added thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? For that vanquiſhed Teſtimony of <hi>Joſephus</hi> by his prevalent Teſtimony does claſh alſo with the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Holy Scripture. Becauſe, if the firſt <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> of <hi>Herod</hi>'s thirty ſeven years Reign be taken, <hi>Herod</hi> muſt die in the year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period 4710. And therefore Chriſt cannot be born later than the year before, <hi>viz.</hi> 4709. for he was born while <hi>Herod</hi> was living, who ſought the Child's life. And the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> plainly declares, that he was about thirty years old when he was baptized of <hi>John,</hi> nay, but beginning to be about thirty years old, as <hi>Beza</hi> and our Engliſh <hi>Tranſlation</hi> has it; but I think <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> has another meaning there. But let him be full thirty years old, going if you will on his thirty one, which will then be <hi>Anno P. J.</hi> 4739. and the thirteenth year of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> But <hi>John</hi> did not begin his preaching before the fifteenth of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34043:63"/>
                  <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign: nor was Chriſt baptized by him before he had begun his preaching, as it is plain out of that Goſpel. Wherefore the taking the firſt <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign inſtead of the latter, is a plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Teſtimony of Holy Writ. To which, eſpecially the ſelf-vanquiſhed Teſtimony of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> muſt of neceſſity yield.</p>
               <p>Moreover, beſides the particular claſhing with this Teſtimony of S. <hi>Luke</hi> that ſets the Baptiſm of Chriſt by <hi>John</hi> after the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> the firſt <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Herod</hi>'s thirty ſeven years Reign, is repugnant to the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks fixt in the <hi>twentieth</hi> year of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> which the Holy Writ makes the only <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks, as I have demonſtrated above. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though the Teſtimony of <hi>Joſephus</hi> in one place were equal to his Teſtimony in another place, even in this caſe, that part of the contradiction is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be held for the truth that correſponds with the Holy Scriptures according to the ſecond <hi>Poſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> in the firſt Chapter. That when Hiſtorians claſh one with another, or one and the ſame Hiſtorian with himſelf, that part of the contradiction is to be held true that beſt complies with the Holy Writ. This is, I ſay, undeniably reaſonable, though the parts of the contradiction ſtood upon equal terms. How much more then when the weight of Divine Teſtimony is added to that part that has the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage already?</p>
               <p>Wherefore he that has but half an eye, as they ſay, may eaſily diſcern that <hi>Joſephus</hi> has committed a <hi>Parepochiſmus</hi> in chuſing the firſt <hi>Epocha</hi> for <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign of thirty ſeven years inſtead of the ſecond. Which if he had choſen, he had neither contradicted
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34043:63"/>himſelf nor the Holy Scriptures, but all would be in perfect eaſe and Harmony, <hi>Joſephus</hi> with the Sacred Scriptures and ancient Fathers, and alſo with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And <hi>Herod</hi> will be found dying in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip of <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Metellus,</hi> and Chriſt born ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of the moſt ancient Fathers four years before in the Conſulſhip of <hi>L. Aelius La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> and <hi>M. Servilius Geminus,</hi> which was the thing to be demonſtrated. For thirty ſeven years from that ſecond <hi>Epocha, viz.</hi> the <hi>Victoria Actiaca</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s being made King by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> do reach exactly into the year of the Conſulſhip of <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Nerva.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>The ſecond way of proving Chriſt born in the Conſulate of</hi> Lamia <hi>and</hi> Geminus, viz. <hi>from the Tax men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by S.</hi> Luke. <hi>Three general Taxes ordered by</hi> Auguſtus. <hi>The Text in S.</hi> Luke <hi>touching this Tax explained, and the Tax found the firſt of thoſe two which were carried on by</hi> Cyrenius. <hi>That this Tax is that mentioned in</hi> Suetonius <hi>and the</hi> Monumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Ancyranum, viz. <hi>the middle Tax, and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Conſulate of</hi> Aelius Catus <hi>and</hi> Sextius Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turninus <hi>according to</hi> T. L. <hi>the year after that of</hi> Lamia <hi>and</hi> Geminus. <hi>That Chriſt was born</hi> Lamia <hi>and</hi> Geminus <hi>being Conſuls, proved from</hi> Auguſtus <hi>his</hi> Decennial <hi>Reſumptions of his Power</hi> Cenſorian <hi>and</hi> Monarchical. <hi>And alſo from the Time-eaten Monument of</hi> Ancyra. <hi>From the teſtimony of</hi> Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus <hi>placing the Birth of our Lord in the twenty eighth year when the Decree for the Tax
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34043:64"/>firſt went out after</hi> Octavius <hi>had the Name of</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus <hi>conferred upon him. Five ſeveral</hi> Epocha's <hi>of</hi> Auguſtus <hi>his Reign, any whereof directing in compute to that time of Chriſt's Nativity that is pointed at by the true</hi> Epocha <hi>of</hi> Daniel<hi>'s Weeks, is argumentative and confirms the ſame. That</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius <hi>his twenty nine years from the perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and ſubjection of the Jews to the</hi> Romans, <hi>reach into the Conſulate of</hi> Vinicius <hi>and</hi> Alfinius. <hi>The great advantage the</hi> twentieth <hi>of</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>has above the</hi> ſeventh, <hi>there being no ſenſe of this latter to be made from any</hi> Epocha's. <hi>Chriſt born in the forty firſt year of</hi> Auguſtus <hi>according to</hi> Irenaeus, Tertullian <hi>and other Fathers, which from a right</hi> Epocha <hi>reaches unto the Conſulate of</hi> Lamia <hi>and</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus. <hi>A clear proof that Chriſt was then born, out of</hi> Euſebius <hi>his</hi> Chronicon. <hi>An Argument offered at by</hi> T. L. <hi>from a paſſage in</hi> Chryſoſtom<hi>'s Homily</hi> De Natali Johannis Baptiſtae.</head>
               <p>AND thus much concerning the firſt way which <hi>T. L.</hi> uſes to prove our Saviour born (as the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks fixes it) in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip of <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Geminus, viz.</hi> from the years of the Reign of <hi>Herod,</hi> his Age, and the year of his Death. For he dying in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Metellus,</hi> it follows by conſequence, the ancient Fathers putting four years diſtance betwixt <hi>Herod</hi>'s Death and Chriſt's Birth, that he muſt be born <hi>Anno</hi> 4716. <hi>P. J. Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>Servilius Geminus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſuls. This is punctually made out to a year by Reaſon and Authentick Teſtimonies, though the Hiſtory in S. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us no more than that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Herod</hi> was dead, Chriſt was termed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34043:64"/>the Angel tells <hi>Mary, Matt.</hi> 2.20. That they were dead that ſought <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the little Child's life. From whence can only be gathered that Chriſt was very young when <hi>Herod</hi> died, but not exactly how many years he was old then. And thus it is alſo with that Note that <hi>Luke</hi> gives of his Nativity. He does not expreſly tell the very year when Chriſt was born, but he tells us ſuch a circumſtance of his Birth, that a ſagacious Hiſtorian may collect the very year, as <hi>Tho. Lydiat,</hi> to his commendation, has done, namely, from the Tax under which Chriſt was born <hi>Luke</hi> 2.2. And this is the ſecond way that <hi>T.L.</hi> takes to prove that Chriſt was born in the Conſulate of <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Geminus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding of which Method we are firſt to take notice, That there were three more general Taxes ordered by <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> This, <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius,</hi> as I have noted above, expreſly tells us in <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Life, <hi>cap.</hi> 27. <hi>Recepit &amp; morum legum<expan>

The <hi>Collega</hi> in his firſt Tax, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Monument in <hi>Ancyra,</hi> was <hi>M. Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa;</hi> and the Tax finiſhed, himſelf being the ſixth time Conſul, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> the ſecond. His <hi>Collega</hi> in the laſt Tax was <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and the Tax finiſhed <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro condito, Sext. Pompeius</hi> and <hi>Sext.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34043:65"/>Conſuls, in the very year when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> died. See <hi>Suetonius in Vita Auguſti, cap.</hi> 97. and <hi>In Vita Tiberii, cap.</hi> 21. And that the firſt Tax was ordered by him and finiſhed <hi>Agrippa</hi> being his <hi>Collega</hi> in the firſt Conſulſhip of <hi>Apuleius</hi> and his own fifth, and his own ſixth and <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s ſecond, <hi>T. L.</hi> makes clear out of <hi>Dion Caſſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things being premiſed, let us conſider the Text of S. <hi>Luke Chap.</hi> 2. And it came to paſs in thoſe days that there went out a Decree from <hi>Caeſar Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> that all the World ſhould be taxed, or enrolled. Hence it is plain that it was, as I may ſo ſpeak, an Oecumenical Tax or Enrolment thus appointed by <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> But there is a further Character in the following verſe: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For ſo it is to be read, the Comma left out betwixt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And then the ſenſe is this, This is the firſt of the two Taxes which were carried on the times when <hi>Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was Governour of <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two Characters therefore here offer themſelves of Chriſt's Birth. (1.) An Oecumenical Tax appointed by <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> (2.) The ſame Tax, the firſt of thoſe that were carried on by <hi>Cyrenius,</hi> the times he was Governour of <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that this Oecumenical Tax mentioned in S. <hi>Luke</hi> is the ſame with the Tax which <hi>Suetonius</hi> and the <hi>Monumentum Ancyranum</hi> ſay, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered alone without a Collegue, is neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from this very Reaſon, becauſe it is Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical. For what can be more abſurd than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo famous or univerſal Tax or Enrolment as this to be left out of that Monument? But now to find out the time when this Oecumenical Enrolment was;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34043:65"/>It is plain in <hi>Dion, lib.</hi> 55. that in the year before the Conſulate of <hi>Meſſala</hi> and <hi>Cinna,</hi> that is to ſay, in the year when <hi>Aelius Catus</hi> and <hi>Sentius Saturninus</hi> were Conſuls, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> alone without a Collegue (elſe in all likelihood he had been named to leſſen the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidiouſneſs of the thing, and beſides this Tax, being neither the firſt nor the laſt, muſt be the middle which he ordered alone) he ended, I ſay, a Tax in the year of thoſe two Conſuls <hi>condito luſtro,</hi> as the Latine Phraſe is. The words of <hi>Dion</hi> are theſe; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>(viz. Auguſtus)</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> taxed thoſe that lived in <hi>Italy,</hi> and were poſſeſſed of two hundred <hi>Seſtertia,</hi> omitting the poorer ſort, and thoſe that lived out of <hi>Italy,</hi> leſt they ſhould cauſe any ſtirs. And that he might not ſeem to do this as a Cenſor, he was inveſted with <hi>Proconſular</hi> Authority, for the more contentfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting this Tax and the <hi>Lustral</hi> Sacrifice that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the ſame. It is true, ſome may ſcruple here how this can be called an <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Tax, when it is ſaid to be <hi>confined</hi> to <hi>Italy.</hi> But <hi>T. L.</hi> ſuggeſts that which is very rational, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Tax, as to the old mode of Taxes, extended no further than <hi>Italy;</hi> but the Enrolment of Names and Eſtates might reach all over: and that this Oecumenical Tax was rather a Project to make his <hi>Rationarium Imperii</hi> more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and complete, for the ſetling a conſtant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Revenue out of all the Provinces of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34043:66"/>to maintain his numerous Armies and Navies, than to levy ſuch a Tax at that time, in the uſual ſenſe of Taxing, upon the whole Empire. This <hi>T. L.</hi> makes out with very ſolid Reaſon from Hiſtory. See his <hi>Recenſio, cap.</hi> 6. And conſentaneouſly to this he cites that Famous Hiſtorian and Antiquary <hi>Hubertus Golizius,</hi> who in his <hi>Annalis Hiſtoria</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> mentions the Numerouſneſs of his Souldiers at that time, and the diſtribution of his ordinary Legions throughout the Provinces, and the Inſtitution of the ſetled Revenue in the Conſulate of <hi>Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>Servilius Geminus,</hi> which immediately precedes that of <hi>Aelius Catus</hi> and <hi>Sentius Saturninus,</hi> in which the middle Tax was finiſhed, as appears out of <hi>Dion.</hi> From whoſe Authority alone it is evident that this middle Tax ended the next year following that of <hi>Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>Servilius Geminus.</hi> How eaſie is it then to conceive that it began at leaſt that very year, if not the year before? Whence it will be plain, that this is the Tax and time when Chriſt was born, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year of <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Geminus,</hi> according as the right <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks requires, and the Age of Chriſt, when he was baptized of <hi>John,</hi> demonſtrates to be true. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. When the thing is brought ſo near, even by profane Hiſtory, we may be ſure the exquiſite truth of it will reach to that which we know to be true by Teſtimony Divine.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, It is obſerved out of the ſame <hi>Dion,</hi> that ſuch was the Policy of <hi>Augustus,</hi> that he made a ſhow as if he would keep the Government ſuch as he received of the Senate, which was to be <gap reason="foreign">

Cornelius Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Cn. Cornelius Lentulus</hi> were Conſuls, as the other with the year before <hi>Saturninus</hi> and <hi>Veſpillo</hi> being Conſuls. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reckoning on ſtill by complete <hi>Decenniums,</hi> the third <hi>Decennium</hi> from <hi>Saturninus</hi> and <hi>Veſpillo</hi> of the <hi>Cenſorian</hi> Power will end in the year before the Conſulſhip of <hi>Silius</hi> and <hi>Munatius:</hi> but the third of the <hi>Imperatorial</hi> in that very year; In which <hi>Dion</hi> ſays, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> did <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Thirdly, The Time-eaten Names of the Conſuls in that <hi>Monumentum Ancyranum</hi> above-mentioned, as riddled out by <hi>T.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34043:67"/>be underſtood of <hi>Aſinius Gallus,</hi> as ſome would have it, who was ten years before <hi>Vinicius</hi> and <hi>Alfinius;</hi> becauſe in <hi>Dion, lib.</hi> 55. neither in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Druſus</hi> and <hi>Criſpinus</hi> immediately before his, nor in <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Piſo</hi>'s that immediately follows, nor in his own is there any mention of any Tax or <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtral</hi> Sacrifice wherewith they wont to be concluded.

               <p>By the bye I will only note, That though it were admitted that Chriſt was born the forty ſecond year
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34043:70"/>of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Reign from <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Panſa,</hi> and in the thirteenth Conſulate of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> this will not ſerve the turn of them that would reckon <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks from the <hi>ſeventh</hi> year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and ſo in the reſt of the Computes of the ancient Fathers, taking them from their <hi>Epocha's.</hi> And the <hi>ſeventh</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> and the <hi>twentieth</hi> being the only <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha's</hi> in competition, it is apparent what an infinite advantage the latter has above the former, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years from a right <hi>Epocha</hi> ſuiting with the latter <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Weeks, but with the former from none, but runs into Contradictions to expreſs Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>Sixthly therefore, <hi>Irenaeus contra Haereſes, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. ſays expreſly, <hi>Natus eſt Dominus noſter circa primum &amp; quadrageſimum annum</hi> Auguſti <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii.</hi> And <hi>Tertullian adverſus Judaeos, cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſimo &amp; primo anno Imperii</hi> Auguſti <hi>naſcitur Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus.</hi> And <hi>Hieronymus</hi> on <hi>Daniel, cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſimo primo anno</hi> Caeſaris Auguſti <hi>Chriſtus natus eſt in Judaea.</hi> To theſe you may add <hi>Caſſiodorus, Sulpicius Severus,</hi> and others. So that there is no queſtion but about this time of the years of <hi>Augustus</hi> his Reign Chriſt was born, according to the Opinion of thoſe Fathers. But now if we deduce theſe forty one years from the Conſulate of <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Panſa,</hi> they will end in the 4711. year <hi>P. J.</hi> From which, if you count thirty years, the time of the Age of Chriſt when he was baptized by <hi>John,</hi> you will make him baptized a year before <hi>John</hi> began to preach and baptize. But if you count from the laſt year of the ſeventy Weeks backward (ſuppoſing the <hi>ſeventh</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to be the <hi>Epocha</hi> of them) Chriſt's Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm or Manifeſtation being in the year immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34043:71"/>preceding the laſt week, or at leaſt in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the firſt year thereof, Chriſt will be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the twelfth or thirteenth of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> two or three years before <hi>John</hi> began to baptize; nor will he be then thirty years old, unleſs he was born two or three years ſooner than this reckoning the forty one years from the Conſulate of <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Panſa</hi> makes him. So uſeleſs and unſuitable for the adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks is this <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Panſa</hi>'s Conſulſhips.</p>
               <p>But there is another moſt Publick <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> his Reign, which was uſually called <hi>Aera Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaris,</hi> and publickly received in a manner over all the Empire, unleſs in <hi>Alexandria</hi> (ſee <hi>Lydiat</hi>'s <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nones Chronici</hi> and his <hi>Recenſio, cap.</hi> 9.) which is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Conſulate of <hi>Claudius Pulcher</hi> and <hi>Norba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Flaccus,</hi> from which if you reckon the forty one years of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Reign, in the laſt whereof <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> and the reſt of the ancient Fathers ſay Chriſt was born, you will be brought into the Conſulſhip of <hi>Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>Servilius Geminus,</hi> the middle year of the middle Tax, which we cannot think harſh to continue three years, whenas the firſt of thoſe three famous Taxes recorded in the <hi>Monumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Ancyranum</hi> continued two years, and the laſt near as much. Reckoning therefore from this right <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Pulcher</hi> and <hi>Flaccus,</hi> thoſe Repugnancies I noted before are avoided, and all made coherent and ſmooth, and the Authorities of thoſe Fathers made very pregnant for the proving that Chriſt was born in the Conſulate of <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Geminus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, That Chriſt was born in the Conſulate of <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Geminus</hi> appears from hence. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> in the Conſulate of <hi>Aelius Catus</hi> and <hi>Sentius Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turninus</hi>

But let <hi>Euſebius</hi> his own <hi>Epocha</hi> be taken, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Conſulate of <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Panſa.</hi> Count forty two years thence, and you will fall into the Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>C.

               <p>

In this year the two young Princes, <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Caius,</hi> being dead, that were <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Corrivals, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> does again impart to <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> after the intermiſſion of his <hi>quinquennial</hi> for four years near upon, a <hi>decennial</hi> Tribunitian Power.</p>
               <p>This is the Chronological Diſpoſure of things for theſe years, according to <hi>T. L.</hi> which he makes good from Authentick Teſtimonies of Hiſtorians, ſuch as <hi>Tacitus, Velleius Paterculus, Suetonius, Dion,</hi> &amp;c. in his <hi>Recenſio, cap.</hi> 11, &amp; 12. and the things themſelves lie in a very natural order and coherency. His pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Tiberius</hi> his obtaining a quinquennial <hi>Tribuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Power at the end of the thirty ninth <hi>Julian</hi> year, is but a ſmall difference from <hi>Dionyſius Petavius</hi> his placing it out of <hi>Dion</hi> in the beginning of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, when <hi>Balbus</hi> and <hi>Antiſtius</hi> were Conſuls. But that makes it the more ſure, that <hi>Caius</hi> his going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34043:75"/>the Eaſt to reduce the <hi>Parthians,</hi> was at leaſt not before the thirteenth Conſulſhip of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaluted by <hi>Tiberius</hi> at <hi>Samos</hi> or <hi>Chios</hi> after the expiration of his quinquennial <hi>Tribunitian</hi> Power. But according to <hi>Suetonius</hi> in his Life, <hi>Cap.</hi> 11, &amp; 12. there being ſuch Tranſactions betwixt the expiration of his quinquennial <hi>Tribunitian</hi> Power, and his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting <hi>Caius</hi> in <hi>Samos,</hi> as would take up ſome time; this I conceive made <hi>T. L.</hi> place the beginning of that quinquennial Power toward the latter end of <hi>Nero</hi>'s and <hi>Piſo</hi>'s Conſulſhip, rather than about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Conſulſhip of <hi>Balbus</hi> and <hi>Antiſtius;</hi> ſo that it will come all to one.</p>
               <p>And this is the main Point that will conduct us to the true time of <hi>Publius Quirinius</hi> or <hi>Cyrenius</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Governour of <hi>Syria,</hi> and the time of the Tax and Chriſt's Nativity. Which that it was not ſome years before the thirteenth Conſulſhip of <hi>Auguſtus, T. L.</hi> in his 12. Chapter of his <hi>Recenſio</hi> makes clearly out againſt the Conceits of <hi>Scaliger, Petavius, Suſlyga, Kepler</hi> and others.

               <p>Again, <hi>Suetonius</hi> writes, that five years after her Baniſhment ſhe was recalled by <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> The time of her being recalled, <hi>Dion</hi> tells us, was in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulate of <hi>Aelius</hi> and <hi>Sentius,</hi> from which Conſulate, if you reckon backwards five years, you will fall again into the thirteenth Conſulate of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:34043:77"/>Tax in the firſt time of his being Governour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and is conſequently that very Oecumenical Tax of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> that the Evangeliſt mentions, and the middle of the three recorded by <hi>Suetonius</hi> and the <hi>Monumentum Ancyranum,</hi> and the Tax wherein Chriſt was born, which laſting three Conſulſhips to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, (for as it began in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Vini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> and <hi>Alfinius,</hi> ſo it ended in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Aelius Catus</hi> and <hi>Sentius Saturninus,</hi> as was above proved out of <hi>Dion;</hi> and as the fore-part of it was carried on by <hi>Cyrenius,</hi> ſo the latter part of it by <hi>Sentius Saturninus</hi> the Conſuls Father and <hi>Cyrenius</hi> his Succeſſour in the Government of <hi>Syria,</hi> as appears out of <hi>Tertullian</hi>)</p>
               <p>It is natural therefore and obvious to place the Birth of Chriſt in the middle Conſulſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>Servilius Geminus,</hi> nothing claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therewith in Hiſtory, and it ſo fitly complying with the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks, the thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Conſulate from thence being the thirtieth year of Chriſt's Age when he was baptized by <hi>John</hi> the firſt year of the laſt week, and the Prophecy ſays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that there were ſeven weeks and ſixty two weeks, that is, ſixty nine weeks from the Decree to build <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Wherefore his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation (which was made at his Baptiſm) was to be expected in the firſt year of the laſt week, as it did indeed fall out according to this Compute. Wherefore this Note of Chriſt's Birth from the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Tax by <hi>Cyrenius</hi> Governour of <hi>Syria</hi> mentioned in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> I take to be a firm Argument to prove that Chriſt was born <hi>Anno Jul.</hi> 48. <hi>Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>Servilius Geminus</hi> being Conſuls. We will add but one Argument more, and then conclude.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:34043:77"/>
               <p>The laſt Argument <hi>T.

Wherein briefly theſe two things are noted, That Chriſt was born when there was an univerſal Peace over the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and the Gates of <hi>Janus</hi> were the third time ſhut by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> and in the year when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> refuſed to be called <hi>Dominus,</hi> Lord. <hi>Oroſius</hi> his miſtakes in that long Paragraph, it is beſides my Scope to take notice of. But as for thoſe two notable Characters of the time of our Saviour's Nativity, we have noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Anno Jul.</hi> 46. <hi>C. Julius Caeſar</hi> and <hi>L. Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Paulus</hi> being Conſuls, <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> concluded a Peace with <hi>Phraates</hi> King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and that the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> was the third time ſhut by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> that year (as it was before twice, the firſt time in his fifth Conſulſhip, <hi>Sextus Apuleius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſul with him, and then in his ninth, <hi>Junius Silanus</hi> being Conſul in the ſame year) during which Oecumenical calm over the Empire Chriſt was born. And if in the year when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> refuſed the ſtile of <hi>Lord,</hi> then it muſt be in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Geminus,</hi> becauſe <hi>Dion</hi> juſt in the ſame place where he ſays, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> refuſed to be called <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Two Objections out of</hi> Joſephus <hi>that would prove that</hi> Caius <hi>took not his Expedition into the Eaſt till after</hi> Herod <hi>was dead.</hi> (1.) <hi>Becauſe</hi> Joſephus <hi>mentions no Civilities done by</hi> Herod <hi>to</hi> Caius <hi>as he paſſed</hi> Judaea. (2.) Joſephus <hi>expreſly ſays, that</hi> Caius <hi>was at that Council that was called at</hi> Rome <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſpoſing of</hi> Herod<hi>'s Kingdom upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe. The Defectuouſneſs, Remiſneſs and Careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of</hi> Joſephus <hi>in ſeveral things, noted by</hi> Tho. Lydiat <hi>and others. His groſs miſtake in the time of the Commiſſion granted to</hi> Nehemiah <hi>noted by the Author. That he cannot be excuſed from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Time or remoteneſs of Country. An Anſwer to the firſt Objection. Whether it was ignorance or diſſimulation in</hi> Joſephus <hi>that he writes nothing of</hi> Caius <hi>his Expedition into the Eaſt.</hi> Herod<hi>'s Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in forecaſting his journey to</hi> Rome, <hi>while</hi> Caius <hi>went into the East. An Anſwer to the ſecond Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that ſuppoſing there was any Son of</hi> Auguſtus <hi>at the above-mentioned Council,</hi> Joſephus <hi>has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a Miſnomer, and ſet down</hi> Caius <hi>for</hi> Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa Poſthumus. <hi>Several Allegations out of Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that it could not be</hi> Agrippa <hi>that</hi> Auguſtus <hi>ſo honoured in that Council. Paſſages out of</hi> Tacitus <hi>and</hi> Dion <hi>that imply that it might be he. That if</hi> Joſephus <hi>did really mean</hi> Caius, <hi>he muſt do it on a ground wherein he groſly contradicts himſelf, and wherein he was more obnoxious to Errour, than in the other part of the Contradiction. That this ſtory
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34043:78"/>of</hi> Caius <hi>his Precedence in the above-named Council is no raſh fiction of</hi> Joſephus, <hi>but handſomly furmiſed upon his committing that notable</hi> Parepochiſm <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Herod<hi>'s Reign.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE have ſeen how agreeable that time of the Nativity of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Geminus,</hi> which the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>'s Weeks, from the <hi>twentieth</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> points at, is to Hiſtory. We ſhould now ſhow in like manner how agreeable to Hiſtory the Times of Chriſt's <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> or <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and of his <hi>Paſſion</hi> are to be found. But we muſt firſt anſwer an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection or two, that ſeem of great moment againſt a chief Argument we have made uſe of, namely the laſt but one, which is grounded upon the time of <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi>'s Expedition into the Eaſt, when he was made Governour of <hi>Syria,</hi> and ſent to conclude a Peace with <hi>Phraates</hi> King of the <hi>Parthians</hi> (after which it is concluded on all ſides that he never retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again to <hi>Rome,</hi> but died in the way when he was returning thither) and ſuppoſes that he undertook this Expedition before the Death of <hi>Herod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the main Objections againſt this, is Firſt, That if <hi>Caius</hi> had took his Journey into the Eaſt while <hi>Herod</hi> was alive, ſith he mought needs ſail by <hi>Judaea,</hi> that <hi>Joſephus</hi> would not have failed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord <hi>Herod</hi>'s Civilities and Attendances on him, as he does thoſe done to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> when they paſſed by. And then, Secondly, That <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> expreſly affirms both in his <hi>De Bello Judaico,</hi> and alſo in his Jewiſh Antiquities, That <hi>Caius</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> after the Death of <hi>Herod,</hi> preſent at that Meeting called about the dividing <hi>Herod</hi>'s Kingdom
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34043:79"/>amongſt his Sons upon his deceaſe. And therefore <hi>Caius</hi> his Expedition into the Eaſt being <hi>Anno Jul.</hi> 44. according to <hi>T. L.</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Herod</hi> dead the year before, or at leaſt the ſame year, and Chriſt born at leaſt the year before that, or ſooner, ſuppoſe <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Jul.</hi> 43, or 42. Chriſt will be born five or ſix years before the Conſulſhip of <hi>L. Aelius Lamia</hi> and <hi>M. Servilius Geminus.</hi> And yet the words of <hi>Joſephus</hi> are expreſs, <hi>De Bello Judaico, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1, or 4. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Greek. There ſays he, ſpeaking of this matter, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> conſidering the Largeneſs of the Revenues of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Kingdom, and the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merouſneſs of his Poſterity, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>In Anſwer to which two Objections we are firſt to conſider whether <hi>Joſephus,</hi> though he be a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Writer, and a Man queſtionleſs of neat Wit and Contrivance; yet whether he be ſo watchful, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and conſummate an Hiſtorian, that we muſt pin our belief on him in every thing he writes. For we have obſerved in our eleventh Chapter how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnantly he has written to himſelf touching the Age of <hi>Herod</hi> and years of his Reign. <hi>Petavius</hi> in his <hi>Rationarium Temporum</hi> does not think him ſo infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, careful or diligent, but that he cries out <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Hîc verò</hi> Joſephi <hi>mira eſt oſcitantia, qui illos ipſos, unde hanc Hiſtoriam deſcripſit, auctores in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiosè legit,</hi> but how rightfully I will not here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. And for the defectuouſneſs of his Hiſtory
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34043:79"/>
                  <hi>T. L.</hi> ſeems juſtly to complain thereof when he wholly omitted the Expedition of <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> into the Eaſt, which yet is a thing as memorable as any thing almoſt in that Age, and the Peace which he there concluded with the <hi>Parthian,</hi> was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Augustus</hi> his ſhutting <hi>Janus</hi> his Temple the third time. Nor muſt we omit what <hi>T. L.</hi> takes notice of in his <hi>Recenſio, cap.</hi> 15. That <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Antiquities, <hi>lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. affirms, that that Tax in which <hi>Quirinius</hi> Governour of <hi>Syria</hi> ſold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated the Goods of baniſhed <hi>Archelaus,</hi> fell in the 37. year of the <hi>Victoria Actiaca,</hi> whenas it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but this ſhould be the third of thoſe three that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> decreed; foraſmuch as the ſecond was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on and finiſhed <hi>Aelius Catus</hi> and <hi>Sentius Saturninus</hi> being Conſuls, as has been above demonſtrated, that is to ſay, in the 34. year of the <hi>Victoria Actiaca, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, Archelaus</hi> his Father, being then living, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt out of Sacred Writ. But the third and laſt Tax was finiſhed a little before <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Death <hi>Pompeius</hi> and <hi>Apuleius</hi> being Conſuls in the 44. year of the <hi>Victoria Actiaca.</hi> Wherefore it is plain, that either out of ignorance or oſcitancy <hi>Joſephus,</hi> as I have noted before, has committed a <hi>Parepochiſmus,</hi> and taken the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Monarchy ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſo underſtood from the time he reigned alone, for the <hi>Epocha</hi> of his abſolute Monarchy when he was inveſted with that moſt Sovereign and Sacroſanct <hi>Tribunitian</hi> Power which was nine years after the <hi>Victoria Actiaca.</hi> From that <hi>Epocha</hi> only it is true that the Tax in which <hi>Quirinius</hi> ſold and confiſcated <hi>Archelaus</hi> his Goods, fell in the 37. year of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Monarchy. In which though the deſcription was made, yet the Execution was ſome two years
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34043:80"/>afterwards. See <hi>T. L.</hi> in that Chapter where he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes out the matter.</p>
               <p>But I do not love to dwell on ſuch a Theme. I will only add one thing more of my own Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Antiquities, <hi>lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that that Commiſſion which was granted to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> for rebuilding <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was granted by <hi>Xerxes,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> which is a groſs <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonomaſma.</hi> And as he is out in the Name, ſo in the Number of the years of the Reign of that Prince when he granted that Commiſſion, which he makes the twenty fifth, inſtead of the twentieth; and then in the extent of the Reign of <hi>Xerxes</hi> he makes him to reign twenty eight years, contrary to <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which makes him reign but twenty one years, and contrary to the Teſtimony of all other Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. And that which was not done till after the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus, viz.</hi> the rebuilding of the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Palaces thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he expreſly affirms <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Theſe things were done in the Reign of <hi>Xerxes.</hi> What can be more wild and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd?</p>
               <p>But haply it will be replied, That though he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch groſs miſtakes in times ſo far removed from the Age he lived in, and in Countries ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from his own, yet he may be more exact in ſuch things as reſpect his own Country, and were done ſo near his own times, as the Affairs of <hi>Herod</hi> were. But though <hi>Perſia</hi> was far from <hi>Judaea,</hi> and the Reign of <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> far from the times of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> yet the Records of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> were near him, and within his reach, one would think, whence
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34043:80"/>he might have informed himſelf better, and not committed ſuch groſs errours, if he had not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs and careleſs. And thus much ſhall ſerve for the preparing the way to an Anſwer to thoſe two main Objections, which we ſhall be able now briefly to diſpatch.</p>
               <p>We anſwer therefore to the firſt, That it is an unreaſonable thing, <hi>Joſephus</hi> wholly omitting the Expedition of <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> into the Eaſt, and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Peace with <hi>Phraates</hi> King of <hi>Parthia,</hi> that we ſhould expect of him the commemorating any Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities or Attendances of <hi>Herod</hi> upon <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> as he paſſed by <hi>Judaea,</hi> it being a contradiction, the whole entirely omitted, there ſhould be mention of any part of that affair. This argues a great defect in <hi>Joſephus</hi> his Hiſtory, but none in <hi>T. L.</hi> his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this matter. But whether <hi>Joſephus</hi> his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or his diſſembling the truth, was the cauſe of this great omiſſion, is not ſo eaſie to determine. <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> in the Life of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> writes of him thus: Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ium <hi>nepotem quòd</hi> Judaeam <hi>praetervehens apud</hi> Hieroſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymam <hi>non ſupplicâſſet, collaudavit.</hi> This pride there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and contempt of <hi>Joſephus</hi> his Religion, who was a <hi>Jew,</hi> might lye in his ſtomach, and make him omit the whole buſineſs of <hi>Caius,</hi> for his omitting his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as he thought, to the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him at his holy Temple, as other Grandees of <hi>Rome</hi> had done. He avoided the Recording the whole Affair of <hi>Caius,</hi> that he might not record this ſlur put upon his Religion. Or it may be it was out of ignorance of this affair, it having no complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Herod</hi>'s at all; <hi>Herod</hi> out of cautiouſneſs and policy, that he might neither offend <hi>Caius</hi> by omitting any Civilities he might expect in his paſſage
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34043:81"/>by <hi>Judaea,</hi> nor <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Corrival by doing them, caſting his journey ſo, that he was on his way to <hi>Rome,</hi> (which is the laſt he made thither) while the other was on his Expedition into the Eaſt, inſomuch that <hi>Herod</hi> was abſent from <hi>Judaea</hi> in that very year when Chriſt was born. This <hi>T. L.</hi> copiouſly makes out in his <hi>Recenſio, cap.</hi> 14. but it is little to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe to purſue it any further: Only this I will note by the bye, that Chriſt being born this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year of <hi>Herod</hi>'s laſt journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> there are ſo many things done by <hi>Herod</hi> after his return re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that leſs than three or four years cannot ſuffice for the atchieving the ſame. Which therefore much confirms the Opinion of the ancient Fathers, that declare that <hi>Herod</hi> lived four years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt was born.</p>
               <p>And now for the other, which is the more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Objection, the Anſwer is ſhort, but I hope ſound. I ſay therefore, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Narration of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius</hi> his being preſent at the Council when the Cauſe of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Sons was pleaded, who ſhould ſucceed him in his Kingdom, (ſuppoſing there was any of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Sons at that Pleading, which I ſpeak, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no other ancient Writer I know of mentions it but himſelf) that he has committed a mere <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomaſma</hi> or Miſnomer therein, as he did in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting ſuch things to <hi>Xerxes</hi> which belong to <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes,</hi> and as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is obſerved by <hi>Petavius</hi> to ſet down <hi>Claudius</hi> inſtead of <hi>Cocceius Nerva</hi> (ſee my <hi>Synopſis Prophetica, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>ſect.</hi> 8.) But this <hi>Antonomaſma</hi> of <hi>Joſephus</hi> in this place is more excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than thoſe others, every thing exquiſitely agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaving the Name. For <hi>Auguſtus</hi> might place firſt in the Council an adopted Son of his born of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34043:81"/>
                  <hi>Agrippa</hi> and his Daughter <hi>Julia,</hi> but his Name was not <hi>Caius,</hi> but <hi>Agrippa Poſthumus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor could there be the leaſt doubt but that it is an Antonomaſtick miſtake, but that Writers give ſuch an ill Character of <hi>Agrippa Poſthumus.</hi> As <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius Paterculus, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Hoc fere tempore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>qui eodem die quo</hi> Tiberius, <hi>adoptatus ab avo ſuo naturali, &amp; jam ante biennium qualis eſſet apparere coeperat, mirâ pravitate animi at<expan>

               <p>WE have cleared the time of the <hi>Nativity</hi> of Chriſt, and ſhowed how conſonant it is to manifold Teſtimonies of Authentick Hiſtory. We proceed now to Chriſt's <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> or <hi>Baptiſm,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:34043:83"/>which according to the indigitation of the true <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks and Hiſtory of Scripture, is the year 4745. <hi>P. J.</hi> and the nineteenth year of the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> the time of the Manifeſtation of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> according to the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> being 69 weeks or 483 years complete, and Chriſt, according to the Teſtimony of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> being about thirty years of Age when he was baptized by <hi>John the Baptist;</hi> which was the time of his <hi>Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt then deſcending upon him in the ſhape of a Dove, and a Voice from Heaven wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing of him, that he was the Meſſias the Son of God. If you reckon incluſively from the Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Geminus,</hi> which was in the 4716. year <hi>P. J.</hi> you will find it juſt thirty years. Which alone, the time of the Nativity of Chriſt being ſo fully cleared, might aſſure us that the Baptiſm of Chriſt was in the nineteenth year of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is there any thing in S. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Goſpel that contradicts this Chronology of Chriſt's Baptiſm poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at by the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks, I mean the <hi>Lydiatean Epocha,</hi> which counts the time from the <hi>twentieth</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus;</hi> whenas the <hi>Funccian</hi> counts from the ſeventh. Whence the <hi>Lydiatean Epocha</hi> has a vaſt advantage of the <hi>Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> the <hi>Funccian</hi> caſting the Baptiſm of Chriſt on the thirteenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> two years before <hi>John</hi> began to baptize; which therefore is a plain contradiction to the Teſtimony of Scripture. But the <hi>Lydiatean</hi> places it after the fifteenth year of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> according to the Teſtimony of S. <hi>Luke;</hi> and though about four years later than others have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, yet conſiſtently enough with the Teſtimony of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> he declaring only that it was after the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34043:84"/>fifteenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> not how many years after the ſame. But becauſe there is no diſtinct mention of years betwixt <hi>John</hi>'s beginning to preach and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, and the time he baptized Chriſt, they have clapt Chriſt's Baptiſm cloſe to the firſt year, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Idiots phanſie the Sky and Moon or Sun at the Horizon to touch the Earth, becauſe they ſee nothing betwixt. But as wiſe men correct their phancy by Reaſon, and in virtue thereof, while the Sky or Moon ſeems to touch the Earth, aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves it is as diſtant therefrom as when it is nearer their Zenith: ſo conſiderate perſons that ponder with themſelves that weighty Province that lay on <hi>John the Baptist</hi>'s ſhoulders (as the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it to <hi>Zachary</hi> his Father, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. And many of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſays he, ſhall he turn to the Lord their God, and he ſhall go before him in the Power and Spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> to turn the heart of the Fathers to the Children, and diſobedient to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Juſt, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord, that is, for the Lord Chriſt) they, I ſay, that rightly conſider this, muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it muſt be a work of ſome years to effect it, eſpecially <hi>John</hi> working no Miracles, and yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gained the eſteem of the people ſo far, by his long and diligent Converſe with them, and repeated Inſtructions to them (whereby he converted many to a pious ſenſe of their duties) that they began to conceive that he might be the promiſed <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> being aware of the nature of the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Province, that he was to go before the face of the Lord Jeſus to prepare the way for his being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the promiſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> calls the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof the finiſhing his courſe, <gap reason="foreign">

But this ſavours of too much Idioticalneſs and Puerility.</p>
               <p>We have couched therefore together at leaſt three, if not four Arguments in one, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the Baptiſm of Chriſt was in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> not in the fifteenth, as is vulgarly conceited. Firſt, in that it is the year im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate to the expiration of the ſixty nine Weeks of <hi>Daniel</hi> which butt upon the Manifeſtation of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> according as that Prophecy aſſures us: <hi>From the going forth of the Decree to rebuild Jeruſalem to Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah the Prince are ſeven weeks and ſixty two weeks, Dan.</hi> 9.25. Secondly, in that it is the firſt year in the laſt week wherein the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is predicted to make a Covenant with many. Thirdly, in that it is the thirtieth year of Chriſt's Age, and ſo many years there are from the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lamia</hi> and <hi>Geminus</hi> to the nineteenth year of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> And laſtly, it being requiſite for ſo great an Undertaking as <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi>'s was, to have ſome number of years to perform it in, and not to tye our Saviour's Baptiſm up to the firſt year of <hi>John</hi>'s baptizing, no more than the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s impriſoning and beheading, which no man will ſay was in the ſame year he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to baptize, becauſe the year it was done in is not mentioned, but the nature of the thing requiring ſome years, we are to be determined for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by the Prophecy, which plainly points out the nineteenth of <hi>Tiberius</hi> for the Meſſias's <hi>Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:34043:85"/>which was at <hi>John</hi>'s baptizing him. Whence it is manifeſt, that the whole courſe of the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, was about four years. In which, though things are not digeſted into Annals, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs <hi>John</hi> beſtirred himſelf notably in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of his Province. The Heads only of his Actions are ſet down <hi>Luke</hi> 3. where at laſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, And many other things (beſides what was written) preached he in his exhortations to the people.</p>
               <p>But though there be no diſtinct Hiſtory of each year of the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Miniſtry, yet there are many paſſages of Hiſtory that comport with this four years extenſion of his Miniſtry before he baptized Chriſt; namely, that he baptized him in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Which firſt, that paſſage in S. <hi>John</hi> ſeems to imply, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them, Deſtroy this Temple, and in three days I will raiſe it up. Then ſaid the Jews, Forty and ſix years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</hi> This paſſage was when Chriſt was come to the <hi>firſt</hi> Paſſeover enſuing his Baptiſm, which was in the month <hi>Marcheſvan</hi> or <hi>Dius</hi> of the <hi>Syromacedones,</hi> which takes in ſome few days of <hi>October,</hi> but the reſt runs into <hi>November.</hi> And <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> beginning his Reign in Autumn, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt this firſt Paſſeover was within the ſame year that Chriſt was baptized. Which we ſay is the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and that this paſſage in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel confirms the ſame. For this is moſt certainly ſpoken of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Temple, the other Temple being demoliſhed, and that built inſtead thereof. The words of <hi>Joſephus</hi> are expreſs, <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34043:85"/>Beſides that Chronologers are horribly out in their endeavours of adjuſting the number of years to the other. Wherefore this muſt be ſpoke of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Temple. And the time that this Temple was begun to be built is the eighteenth year of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign. Some make the <hi>Epocha</hi> of this his Reign to be in the year of the Conſulſhip of <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Caninius,</hi> when by the help of <hi>Soſius</hi> againſt <hi>Antigonus, Herod</hi> took <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo poſſeſſed himſelf of the Metropolis of his Kingdom. But beſides that this <hi>Epocha</hi> is more obſcure and ſlight than thoſe other two, the firſt when by the Favour of <hi>Antony,</hi> the other of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> he was made King of <hi>Judaea,</hi> it falls a year or two ſhort even of the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> till when <hi>John</hi> did not baptize at all. But the <hi>Epocha</hi> of his firſt being made King of the Jews, namely by <hi>M. Antony,</hi> that is yet more impertinent, and anticipates the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius</hi> four or five years.</p>
               <p>Wherefore there is a neceſſity of reckoning <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s eighteen years, from his being made King by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> or from the <hi>Victoria Actiaca.</hi> And from the eighteenth year of his Reign from this <hi>Epocha</hi> (which will fall into the year of the Conſulſhip of <hi>Claudius Nero</hi> and <hi>Quintilius Varus</hi>) to the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> is juſt forty five years. So that the Jews reckoned right within a ſingle year. Which the Authority of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and the infallible Teſtimony of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy may very well have a right to rectifie. Or for their better credit we may conceive (foraſmuch as <hi>Herod</hi> is ſaid, (<hi>De Bello Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daico, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 16.) by <hi>Joſephus</hi> to have done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Temple the fifteenth year of his Reign, before he undertook this vaſt Deſign mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34043:86"/>that in the two or three years ſpace preceding, whatever doing or undoing of things there were, they might gueſs upon the whole Compute, that there was a years furtherance toward the building of the Temple before the commencement of this grand Enterpriſe indeed, which added antecedently to forty five years makes forty ſix, nor diſturbs the years of the right <hi>Epocha,</hi> but adjuſts all well, and makes all three agree, <hi>Daniel, Joſephus,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> that made this ſmart Repartie to our Saviour. They having ſo fair a Plea for it, it is no wonder they ſtretched one ſingle year above the time from the right <hi>Epocha</hi> of Numbering. But in the mean time it is evident, that this is no mean proof for the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Baptiſm of Chriſt in the nineteenth year of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>T. L.</hi> in his <hi>Recenſio, cap.</hi> 19. out of <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> makes it plain, that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was not beheaded till about the time that <hi>Vitellius</hi> was Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>Syria.</hi> Now <hi>Lucius Vitellius,</hi> as appears out of the ſixth Book of <hi>Tacitus</hi> his <hi>Annals,</hi> was made Governour of the Eaſt, <hi>Ceſtius Gallus</hi> and <hi>Servilius Rufus</hi> being Conſuls about the midſt of the twenty firſt year of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Wherefore <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> who lived not quite two years after his baptizing Chriſt, could not be killed before the beginning of the one and twentieth of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Which therefore plainly argues, that he baptized Chriſt in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of his Reign.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. there is mention of ſome that told <hi>Jeſus</hi> of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> whoſe blood <hi>Pilate</hi> mingled with their Sacrifices. Which abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance as well of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers as the <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fician,</hi> look upon to be the ſame perſons that thoſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34043:86"/>
                  <hi>Samaritans</hi> were, of whom <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> write, the former <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. the other <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>De excidio Hieroſolymitano,</hi> that <hi>Pilate</hi> ſlew them when they met together to ſacrifice on Mount <hi>Gerazim.</hi> For <hi>Pilate,</hi> as <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> intimates, made as if he had a mind <hi>Eorum myſteria cognoſcere.</hi> But the <hi>Samaritans</hi> or <hi>Galileans</hi> intending to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, though they were cut off by <hi>Pilate</hi> before they had aſcended the Hill, and were in the very Act, <hi>Fame,</hi> that loves to <hi>add</hi> to things of this nature, what may make them more <hi>Tragical,</hi> aſtoniſhing and ſurpriſing, might phraſe it ſo, that they mingled their blood with their Sacrifices, and tell that they were ſlain in the very Act of ſacrificing. Theſe two ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are ſo exceeding like one another, that a ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Spirit, notwithſtanding the little difference in ſome things, will eaſily acknowledge them the ſame. For that difference of Name, thoſe in S. <hi>Luke</hi> calling them <hi>Galileans,</hi> whenas <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> call them <hi>Samaritans,</hi> is but a ſlight buſineſs, ſith the ſame perſons may be both <hi>Samaritans</hi> and <hi>Galileans</hi> at once, by Religion <hi>Samaritans,</hi> by Country <hi>Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and ſuch <hi>T.

For they have <hi>only phanſied</hi> the ſtory of <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> to be ſome four or five years later than that which thoſe tell of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileans</hi> in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> becauſe they have <hi>preſumed</hi> that our Saviour's Paſſion was ſo many years ſooner than indeed it was.</p>
               <p>But this very Narration in <hi>Joſephus</hi> does <hi>T. L.</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:34043:87"/>make uſe of, and that rationally and judiciouſly to prove that our Saviour was alive till about the middle of the twenty ſecond year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> foraſmuch as <hi>Joſephus</hi> in the fore-named place doth write, that the Chief of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> by Religion, and <hi>Galileans</hi> by Nation (and that was the cauſe of <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi>'s falling out, that <hi>Pilate</hi> would preſume to do execution upon perſons that belonged to <hi>Herod</hi>'s Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and they were Friends again upon <hi>Pilate</hi>'s ſending Chriſt a <hi>Galilean</hi> to <hi>Herod, Luke</hi> 23.12.) addreſſing, I ſay, themſelves to <hi>Vitellius</hi> Governour of <hi>Syria,</hi> accuſed <hi>Pilate</hi> of the Murder committed on theſe <hi>Galileans.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Vitellius</hi> ſending his Friend <hi>Marcellus</hi> to be Procurator of <hi>Judaea,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Pilate</hi> to pack to <hi>Rome</hi> to anſwer his Accuſers there before the Emperour.

That Chriſt ſuffered the twenty ſecond of</hi> Tiberius <hi>proved out of</hi> Epiphanius: <hi>As alſo from what is ſaid</hi> Joh. 11.49. <hi>That</hi> Caiaphas <hi>was High-Prieſt that year. And likewiſe from</hi> Pilate<hi>'s not acquainting</hi> Tiberius <hi>with the News of Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection till the twenty ſecond of his Reign. The Baptiſm of Chriſt in the nineteenth of</hi> Tiberius <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the troubles that fell upon the Jews in the third of</hi> Caius Caligula. <hi>From the Tradition of</hi> Apollonius, <hi>that Chriſt charged the Apoſtles not to preach the Goſpel to the Gentiles till twelve years after the commencement thereof. From</hi> Paul<hi>'s jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying from</hi> Antioch <hi>to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>when</hi> Herod <hi>King of</hi> Chalcis <hi>dyed.

               <p>THE three laſt Arguments for the proving Chriſt's <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to have been the nineteenth of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign, were drawn from ſuch <hi>paſſages</hi> as fell out betwixt the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of Chriſt and his <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion;</hi> thoſe that follow are ſuch as prove the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of Chriſt to fall out in the twenty ſecond of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> or <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> in the nineteenth. And here note, That whatever Arguments prove that Chriſt was crucified in the twenty ſecond year of <hi>Tiberius, ipſo facto</hi> prove he was baptized in the nineteenth of his Reign; it being generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the time of Chriſt's Miniſtry after his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> till his <hi>Crucifixion</hi> is about three years and an half. So that though the time of the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Miniſtry be not digeſted into ſo many diſtinct years in the Evangeliſts, yet there are ſo many diſtinct Arguments to prove it laſted from the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius</hi> till the nineteenth of his Reign, that it may well compenſate that defect, and aſſure us that the Paradox is true.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, where he makes <hi>Herod</hi> the Tetrarch, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the time that Chriſt was crucified, to ſucceed <hi>Archelaus</hi> after his nine years Reign, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares expreſly, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34043:88"/>&amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> In the twentieth year of <hi>Herod</hi> the Tetrarch our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſuffered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>Chronicon,</hi> and <hi>Sulpicius Severus, Hiſtor. Sacrae lib.</hi> 2. aſcribe to <hi>Herod</hi> the Tetrarch twenty four years after the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of <hi>Archelaus;</hi> And <hi>Joſephus, Antiq. lib.</hi> 19. <hi>cap. ult.</hi> tells us, that <hi>Caius</hi> added his Tetrarchy to the Kingdom of <hi>Agrippa</hi> about the beginning of the fourth year of his Reign, about the middle of the twenty fourth year from the ſecond year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign complete. From hence therefore reckon twenty years, and you ſhall fall into the twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> So that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> declaring that Chriſt ſuffered in the twentieth year of <hi>Herod</hi> the Tetrarch after the Baniſhment of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> does therewith ſubſcribe to <hi>Tho. Lydiat</hi>'s Opinion, that our Saviour ſuffered the twenty ſecond of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.49. There <hi>Caiaphas</hi> is ſaid to be High-Prieſt that year. And ſo he was for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years before, as may appear out of <hi>Joſephus.</hi> Wherefore it naturally implies, that that was the laſt year of his being High-Prieſt, and that in the year following he ſhould be put out of his Office, as he was by <hi>Vitellius</hi> near the time of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Death, and <hi>Jonathan</hi> put in his room. And ſo within a year after he had delivered Chriſt upon pretence of Blaſphemy to <hi>Pilate</hi> the Roman Preſident to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, himſelf was deprived of his High-Prieſtood, <hi>Pilate</hi> of his Preſidentſhip of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Tiberius</hi> of the pleaſures of this preſent life, of which with him <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> was no ſmall ſhare.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34043:89"/>
                  <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. tells us how <hi>Pilate</hi> wrote to <hi>Tiberius</hi> to acquaint him with that aſtoniſhing Miracle that had happened in <hi>Judaea, viz.</hi> our Saviour Chriſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the Dead, and his Aſſumption or Aſcenſion into Heaven. Which thing being ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and ſo certain, according to the cuſtom of the Provincial Magiſtrates it was impoſſible but <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhould acquaint <hi>Tiberius</hi> with it ſo ſoon as it was done. But he did not acquaint him with it by Letters till the twenty ſecond or toward the twenty third year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign, according to <hi>Euſebius</hi> his own <hi>Chronicon,</hi> where he ſets it down laſt in the twenty ſecond year of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Wherefore Chriſt did not riſe again and aſcend into Heaven, nor conſequently ſuffer till the twenty ſecond of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, As theſe three laſt Arguments by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the time of Chriſt's <hi>Crucifixion</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> prove alſo the time of his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Manifeſtation;</hi> ſo there are other Arguments taken from the time of the Expiration of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s laſt Week, wherein he tells us the Meſſias will make a Covenant with many (intimating a more peaceful condition of the Jews for thoſe ſeven years) that argue the Manifeſtation of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> or his Baptiſm to be in the nineteenth of <hi>Tiberius. Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>Chronicon</hi> tells us, that <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> in the third year of his Reign, Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio <hi>Praefecto</hi> Syriae <hi>praecepit ut in</hi> Hieroſolymis <hi>ſtatuam ſuam ſub nomine</hi> Jovis Optimi Maximi <hi>poneret.</hi> Nay, he ſays, <hi>Toto orbe</hi> Romano <hi>in Synagogis</hi> Judaeorum <hi>ſtatuae &amp; imagines &amp; arae</hi> C. Caeſari <hi>conſecratae.</hi> What a Cloud of miſchief does there appear for the Jews juſt upon the expiration of the ſeventieth or laſt Week of <hi>Daniel?</hi> For the laſt year of that week was the year going before from the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>'s
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34043:89"/>Weeks. But about this very time the Jewiſh Ambaſſadours from <hi>Alexandria, Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Cyrene,</hi> come to <hi>Rome</hi> to complain of the denying of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities granted heretofore by the <hi>Ptolemies,</hi> were moſt injuriouſly and contumeliouſly dealt with, and grievouſly handled even before the Emperour, as <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> reports. And <hi>Joſephus</hi> writes, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame time (<hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 28. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.) in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucia</hi> and <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> two chief Cities of <hi>Babylonia</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> there were above fifty thouſand <hi>Jews</hi> ſlain, and the reſt expelled and baniſhed out of moſt of the Cities of thoſe Countries. Which beginning of miſery to the Jewiſh Nation commencing then juſt at the expiration of the laſt week, is no mean confirmation that the weeks expired the year before, and that therefore Chriſt was baptized, or the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> manifeſted the ſeventh year before that, <hi>viz.</hi> in the nineteenth of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Something like to this way of arguing is that other of <hi>T. L.</hi> from a Tradition recorded in <hi>Euſebius</hi> his <hi>Hiſtoria Eccleſiaſt. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. from <hi>Apollonius: Dominum Apoſtolis ſuis praecepiſſe ne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te duodecim annorum terminum</hi> Hieroſolymis <hi>diſcede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</hi> Which were a childiſh thing to conceive our Saviour meant groſly of the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but of the Nation of the Jews, that they ſhould not preach the Goſpel to the Gentiles till twelve years after the beginning of the preaching thereof. Which we all know was begun by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> in the fifteenth year of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Now the twelfth year from the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius</hi> is the third year of <hi>Caius Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula,</hi> and under this year does <hi>Spondanus</hi> place the Converſion of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion by <hi>Peter. Hoc anno,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Caio iterum &amp;</hi> Apronio <hi>Conſuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34043:90"/>Petrus Apoſtolus divinâ viſione omnigenarum ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantium de oſtio Eccleſiae Gentibus aperiendo monitus primum omnium Gentilem</hi> Cornelium <hi>Centurionem ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizavit.</hi> Now <hi>Alſtedius</hi> and others place the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion in the fifth year after Chriſt's Paſſion and Aſcenſion. Wherefore reckon backward from the third year of <hi>Caius,</hi> and the fifth year falls into the twenty ſecond of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which again argues the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of Chriſt to have been in the nineteenth of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> There are yet ſeveral other Arguments to evince the ſame, from matters done by S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſome four years later than Chronologers vulgarly deem them. Wherefore add theſe four years to the eighteenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> wherein <hi>Petavius</hi> and others will have Chriſt to have been crucified, and we ſhall find him crucified in the twenty ſecond of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and conſequently ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized in the nineteenth.</p>
               <p>Sixthly therefore, <hi>Herod</hi> mentioned in the Acts, who was King of <hi>Chalcis,</hi> and inveſted by <hi>Claudius</hi> with a Power over the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the High-Prieſthood, and upon that might the better preſume to put <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle, the Brother of <hi>John,</hi> to death, and <hi>Peter</hi> into priſon: This <hi>Herod, Joſephus</hi> expreſly tells us died in the eighth year of the Reign of <hi>Claudius.</hi> But <hi>Paul,</hi> as it appears in the Acts of the Apoſtles, brought the Contribution of the Chriſtians of <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> upon the account of a general Famine at that time when this <hi>Herod</hi> is ſaid to be eaten up of worms. Wherefore this journeying of <hi>Paul</hi> from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which Chronologers ordinarily place in the fourth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> being found to be in the eighth, it muſt needs pull down the whole Series of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34043:90"/>actions four years lower than ordinarily they are ſet. And his Converſion muſt not be in the twentieth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as <hi>Petavius</hi> would have it, but in the firſt of <hi>Caius Caligula;</hi> and all being agreed, there is but about two years diſtance from the Paſſion of Chriſt and <hi>Paul</hi>'s Converſion, Chriſt muſt ſuffer in the twenty ſecond of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and be baptized in the nineteenth.</p>
               <p>It is true that <hi>Euſebius, Hiſtor. Eccleſiaſt. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. makes this <hi>Herod</hi> in the Acts the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with <hi>Agrippa,</hi> of whom <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells a ſtory of his death ſomewhat like this in the Acts touching <hi>Herod;</hi> but for the greater grace of the buſineſs, he converts the <hi>Owl</hi> there mentioned ſitting on an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Rope into an <hi>Angel,</hi> and in the end confeſſes that either the Party of whom the ſtory is told, had two Names, or the Scribe out of miſtake ſet down <hi>Agrippa</hi> for <hi>Herod.</hi> But this ancient Writer leading the way, the generality of Interpreters have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <hi>Eraſmus, Grotius</hi> and ſeveral others. But how conſiderately, I appeal to the judicious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Reader. For the Caſe ſtands thus: <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> were two Brothers, and both Kings, and had thoſe diſtinct Names to be known by, and it is a Fiction that all the Progeny of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great were called <hi>Herods,</hi> they ſucceed him in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Names, <hi>Archelaus, Herod</hi> and <hi>Philip.</hi> And <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaus</hi> being dead, <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> as ſurviving Tetrarchs, are mentioned in their proper Names, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. and ſo queſtionleſs this <hi>Herod</hi> in the Acts (Brother to <hi>Agrippa</hi>) that was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>eaten by worms,</hi> is called by his proper Name, as well as the former. And we may be the more aſſured of it that it was not his Brother <hi>Agrippa</hi> but he, becauſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34043:91"/>it had been an unſpeakable injury to <hi>Herod</hi> to have his Name uſed in a wrong place, if thoſe actions of murdering <hi>John,</hi> and impriſoning of <hi>Peter,</hi> and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Cruelties to pleaſe the people, and dying ſo execrable and ignominious a death, belonged to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and not to him. What can be more intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than ſuch a conceit as this? Beſides that <hi>Joſephus</hi> gives a very fair Character of <hi>Agrippa</hi> inconſiſtent with that Cruelty that is noted in <hi>Herod.</hi> And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> not guilty of that murderouſneſs and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church which this <hi>Herod</hi> was, it muſt ſeem a very ſevere hand of God upon him to be ſo horribly puniſhed for not rebuking the people for a <hi>Complement,</hi> which ſignifies no more, than that he ſeemed to them like an Angel of God, who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And ſo they explain themſelves, that they look't upon him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not that he was thought or called by them the Eternal God, but aſſimilated to an immortal Angel. <hi>Achiſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.9. ſays as much to <hi>David,</hi> I know thou art good in my ſight, as an <hi>Angel of God;</hi> and yet <hi>David</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves him not, nor is ſtruck by the hand of God for not reproving him. All theſe things duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered may aſſure any one, that it was not this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> that was thus eaten up with worms, but <hi>Herod</hi> King of <hi>Chalcis,</hi> his Brother, and that whenas the ſtory belonged to one of the two Brothers, <hi>Joſephus</hi> has happened out of heedleſueſs or ignorance to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that manner of death, though in ſomewhat a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved diſguiſe, to <hi>Agrippa</hi> that belonged to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Herod;</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> has alſo happened to apply the year of <hi>Herod</hi>'s death to <hi>Agrippa.</hi> Such ſlips there will be in Hiſtorians. But careful and judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of them, ſuch as <hi>T. L.</hi> was, will diſcern where the Truth lies.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:34043:91"/>
               <p>Seventhly therefore, Foraſmuch as the former journeying of S. <hi>Paul</hi> from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the time when <hi>Herod</hi> died, <hi>viz.</hi> in the eighth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> is about three years diſtant from his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he took to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from <hi>Antioch</hi> about the Controverſie touching Circumciſion, upon which occaſion a Synod was called at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> alſo was preſent, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. which journeying of <hi>Paul,</hi> as appears from <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. was <hi>fourteen</hi> years <hi>after</hi> his <hi>Converſion,</hi> as <hi>Vatablus</hi> expreſly declares upon the place: It is manifeſt, that in the eleventh year of <hi>Claudius</hi> it was fourteen years ſince the Converſion of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Tell therefore from the eleventh of <hi>Claudius</hi> backward till you come to the fourteenth year, and you fall into the ſecond year of <hi>Caius Caligula.</hi> Then therefore was <hi>Paul</hi> converted. But all are agreed it was but about two years after the <hi>Paſſion of Chriſt.</hi> Whence therefore again it will be found that Chriſt ſuffered in the twenty ſecond of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and was baptized in the nineteenth year of his Reign.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, In the <hi>Acts, Chap.</hi> 18. there <hi>Paul</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving departed from <hi>Athens</hi> came to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and finds <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> Jews lately come from <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> becauſe <hi>Claudius</hi> had commanded all Jews to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> alſo notes in the Life of <hi>Claudius.</hi> But that theſe Stirs and Decree were about the twelfth year of <hi>Claudius, Joſephus</hi> informs us, <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. where preſently upon the ſtory of thoſe Stirs raiſed in <hi>Judaea</hi> by the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans,</hi> ſeveral of whom were ſent to anſwer it before the Emperour at <hi>Rome,</hi> which gave <hi>Claudius</hi> occaſion, as <hi>Oroſius</hi> intimates, to make that Decree of expelling the Jews out of the City, preſently: I
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34043:92"/>ſay, upon that ſtory <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. And having compleated the twelfth year of his Reign (and therefore going on his thirteenth) he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Philip</hi>'s Tetrarchy on <hi>Agrippa junior</hi> (Newphew to <hi>Herod</hi> King of <hi>Chalcis</hi>) and <hi>Batanaea</hi> and <hi>Trachoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> with <hi>Abila,</hi> which was the Tetrarchy of <hi>Lyſias,</hi> but took from him <hi>Chalcis</hi> when he had been Ruler of it four years, as ſucceeding his Uncle <hi>Herod,</hi> who died in the eighth year of <hi>Claudius</hi> his Reign, as was obſerved above. Which ſhows plainly, that the Stirs and the Decree againſt the Jews, to ſend them packing from <hi>Rome,</hi> was in the twelfth of <hi>Claudius</hi> his Reign. Which Stirs of the Jews and <hi>Samaritans, Tacitus (Annal. lib.</hi> 12.) places under the Conſulſhip of <hi>Fauſtus Sylla</hi> and <hi>Salvius Otho,</hi> who bore that Office in the twelfth of <hi>Claudius</hi> his Reign. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi>'s departure from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Corinth</hi> being not till after the twelfth of <hi>Claudius</hi> completed, which is three or four years later than <hi>Spondanus, Petavius</hi> and others place it, they placing it in the ninth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> the Series of the Acts of <hi>Paul</hi> will bring down his <hi>Converſion</hi> about three or four years later, and conſequently the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, It is written <hi>Acts</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 12. And when <hi>Gallio</hi> was Deputy of <hi>Achaia,</hi> the Jews made inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection with one accord againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. Now there was that Enmity betwixt <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Gallio</hi> the Brother of <hi>Seneca</hi> (both which are famous for their ſcoffings at, or rather uttering bitter Sarcaſms againſt <hi>Claudius</hi> when he was dead, <hi>Seneca</hi> writing a Satyr againſt him which he called <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore <hi>Paul</hi>'s departure from <hi>Corinth</hi> (where he is ſaid to have ſtayed a year and ſix months, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.11.) cannot be till then, till about the end of the firſt year of <hi>Nero.</hi> Which therefore is a Ratification of the time of his Arrival there, and implies more roundly that it was four years later than <hi>Spondanus</hi> and <hi>Petavius</hi> place it.</p>

Wherefore it is hugely credible that we ſhould read <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, the <hi>ten years</hi> being finiſhed that <hi>Felix</hi> had been Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Judaea, Porcius Feſtus</hi> ſucceeded him. For that <hi>Felix</hi> had by this time been Preſident ten years, appears thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his Life declares of himſelf, that he was born in the firſt year of the Reign of <hi>Caius,</hi> and that being full twenty ſix years old he came to <hi>Rome</hi> to free certain Jewiſh Prieſts of his acquaintance that <hi>Felix</hi> had ſent thither while he was Preſident of <hi>Judaea,</hi> that he did effect his buſineſs by the Favour of <hi>Poppaea, Nero</hi>'s Wife. Wherefore <hi>Joſephus</hi> being born the firſt year of <hi>Caius,</hi> he was twenty ſix years of Age about the eighth year of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Aſinius</hi> being Conſuls; At what time <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> relates <hi>Annal. lib.</hi> 14. that <hi>Poppaea</hi> was married to <hi>Nero.</hi> Now this ſending of theſe Prieſts to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Felix,</hi> being at the end of his Preſidency (for theſe Prieſts he ſent being <hi>Joſephus</hi> his ſpecial Friends [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] he differred no time for their deliverance) it is plain that <hi>Felix</hi> was Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Judaea</hi> about ten years, and that <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the ſeventh of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign, not the ſecond, and that therefore <hi>Paul</hi>'s being brought
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34043:93"/>bound to <hi>Rome,</hi> is full four years later than <hi>Petavius</hi> has placed it, who places it in the third year of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, Voluſius Saturninus</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> being Conſuls. See <hi>Helvicus, Funccius</hi> and <hi>Calviſius</hi> that place the beginning of <hi>Felix</hi> his Preſidency in the third year of the 207. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and the eleventh of <hi>Claudius;</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who leaps from <hi>Felix</hi> to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> taking no notice of <hi>Feſtus</hi> and <hi>Albinus,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſhort ſtay in Office. <hi>Paul</hi>'s being brought bound to <hi>Rome</hi> therefore being four years later, his <hi>Converſion</hi> is neceſſarily four years later, not in the twentieth of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as <hi>Petavius</hi> has put it, but in the ſecond of <hi>Caius.</hi> Whence Chriſt's <hi>Crucifixion</hi> is again in the twenty ſecond of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in the nineteenth.</p>
               <p>This is a pregnant proof, out of which there is no evaſion, unleſs, with <hi>Baronius,</hi> we will impute ignorance to <hi>Joſephus</hi> of thoſe things himſelf was an Actor in, and ſay he knew not his own Age, but miſtook five or ſix years, which is next to the not knowing his own Name, as <hi>T. L.</hi> has well noted againſt <hi>Baronius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, (for it were too long to bring all <hi>T. L.</hi> his Arguments into view) It is acknowledged by <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> contended for by <hi>T. L.</hi> and proved out of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi> that the firſt Perſecution (which was under <hi>Nero</hi>) was in the eleventh year of his Reign, <hi>Leca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Boſſus</hi> and <hi>Licinius Craſſus</hi> being Conſuls. The occaſion to which Perſecution was <hi>Nero</hi>'s own bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Rome,</hi> which horrid Fact he would have caſt upon the Chriſtians to conceal himſelf. <hi>Ergo abolendo rumori</hi> Nero <hi>ſubdidit reos, &amp; quaeſitiſſimis poenis affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit quos vulgus Chriſtianos appellabat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Igitur primi correpti qui fatebantur, deinde indicio eorum multitudo
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34043:94"/>ingens, haud perinde in crimine incendii quàm odio humani generis convicti ſunt,</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore the Chriſtians being ſo univerſally hated, and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> being then at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the great Sticklers for and Promoters of that Religion it is incredible but they went to pot with the firſt; beſides that this cruel Freak of <hi>Nero</hi> ſeems, out of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> to be but one continued Act of his, the above-named <hi>Lecanius</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> being Conſuls. <hi>Peter</hi> therefore ſuffered Martyrdom in the eleventh year of <hi>Nero.</hi> But in <hi>Euſebius</hi> his <hi>Chronicon, lib.</hi> 1. and alſo in S. <hi>Jerom</hi> in the Life of S. <hi>Peter, Peter</hi> is ſaid to have been poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Sacerdotal Chair twenty five years at his death. But where he was poſſeſſed of it, at <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> and from what time, whether from the laſt of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> or from the ſecond or third of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> or from what other time, is uncertain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial; yet this in general ſeems leſs dubitable, that this twenty five years is his time of his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſince the Apoſtles diſperſing themſelves upon the expiration of the twelve years, that our Saviour is ſaid to reſtrain them to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or rather to the Nation of the Jews. What ſo likely an <hi>Epocha</hi> of the twenty five years as this? And if you count from the eleventh of <hi>Nero</hi> till twenty five backwards, you fall into the fourth of <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſucceeds the expiration of the twelve years aboveſaid: ſo that the fourth of <hi>Caius</hi> is the <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Cathedra Sacerdotalis.</hi> Which yet is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed out of the <hi>Chronicon</hi> of <hi>Marcellinus Comes,</hi> who writes that, <hi>Indictione tertiâ, Philoxenus</hi> and <hi>Probus</hi> being Conſuls (<hi>Helvicus</hi> calls him <hi>Probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and places them in the year of our Lord 525.) Pope <hi>John</hi> came to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the 485 year of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34043:94"/>the Seſſions of the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Peter.</hi> Now, what is an eaſie conceſſion, if we but ſuppoſe theſe five hundred twenty five years, and four hundred eighty five complete, ſo that it may imply the two hundred fifty ſix, and four hundred eighty ſix cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, <hi>Philoxenus</hi> and <hi>Probus</hi> or <hi>Probinus</hi> being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, if you count but from that Conſulate four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eighty, ſix years backwards, you will again fall into the fourth year of <hi>Caius,</hi> and then, as was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the fifth Argument, the twelfth year of the Apoſtles reſtraint to the Jewiſh Nation, being the fifth from Chriſt's Aſcenſion, it is again manifeſt that Chriſt <hi>ſuffered</hi> in the twenty ſecond of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and was <hi>baptized</hi> in the nineteenth.</p>
               <p>And thus there being ſo many <hi>happy</hi> hits in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and Chronologers comporting and complying with the Times of the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> of our Saviour pointed to by the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks, namely the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi> in <hi>T.

That thoſe that make choice of that other <hi>Epocha,</hi> the ſeventh of <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes,</hi> produce Hiſtorians and Chronologers of their ſide alſo, is with all readineſs acknowledged. Nor is there any Point controverted in Chronology and Hiſtory, but there muſt be ſuch Teſtimonies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged on both ſides, elſe it could be no Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. But the main Allegations of the adverſe Party, and on which the greateſt ſtreſs of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion lies, have been ſufficiently anſwered by us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, even keeping our ſelves within the bounds of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34043:95"/>
                  <hi>humane</hi> Teſtimony. But the weight of our ſecond <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> being added thereto, which I have ſet down in the firſt Chapter, ſhows their pretence to be infinitely light and vain. So that I hope the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced and conſiderate will eaſily perceive and acknowledge that the genuine <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks is rightly ſetled and determined for ever to the Glory of God, the Edification of his Church, and the immortal Credit of <hi>Thomas Lydiat,</hi> a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, induſtrious and faithful Member thereof, and painful Proteſtant Miniſter of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> To abet whom in ſo rightful a Cauſe, I thought but a piece of Juſtice due to <hi>Him,</hi> to the <hi>Truth,</hi> and to the <hi>Honour</hi> of our <hi>Engliſh Church</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have received yours, and am glad that you have reaped that ſatisfaction in reading my <hi>Expoſition of the Apocalypſe,</hi> that you profeſs you have, ſaving in that one paſſage, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 6. where I take the <hi>first Reſurrection</hi> applied to the Martyrs in a <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> ſenſe. I am glad ſo good a Wit and Judgment as yours reſts ſatisfied in the reſt. I ſhall therefore endeavour to convince you, that my Expoſition in this paſſage is as eaſie, natural and ſmooth as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For I conceive that <hi>Expoſition</hi> is moſt <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> that has the leaſt tricks and devices in it, and runs not from the proper ſignification of Words to Allegories and Metaphors, when there is no neceſſity ſo to do. Which Rule in this very
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34043:96"/>place the Primitive Chriſtians followed, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded from hence, that a <hi>firſt Reſurrection</hi> in the <hi>proper</hi> ſenſe was the peculiar Priviledge of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, from which perſwaſion they were alſo the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter encouraged to ſuffer Martyrdom. And I appeal to your ſelf, ſuppoſing there were ſuch a <hi>first Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> belonging to the Martyrs, whether the words of the Text do not exquiſitely well fit it, which therefore muſt be, if true, the moſt natural and eaſie ſenſe thereof. Conſider that Saying of our Saviour Chriſt to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which is that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Church wherein ſo many ſuffered Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: <hi>He that overcometh</hi> (namely, by couragiouſly ſuffering Martyrdom) <hi>ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death,</hi> and compare it with what occurs here <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in the firſt Reſurrection, on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where Holy <hi>(Sanctus) Grotius</hi> interprets thus: <hi>Sanctus hîc idem quod ſemotus ab omni malo.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged alſo by <hi>Grotius.</hi> But is it not more full, eaſie and natural to take it in the <hi>proper</hi> phyſical ſenſe, than in this more <hi>maimed</hi> and <hi>dwindling</hi> ſenſe, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34043:96"/>to confeſs that this <hi>firſt Reſurrection</hi> is alſo a <hi>Reſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of the Soul into a perfect bleſſed Immortality by her union with an <hi>Heavenly</hi> or <hi>glorified</hi> Body? And your ſelf alſo acknowledges, that there is a great fitneſs in the thing, that when the <hi>Millennial</hi> ſtate takes, the Martyrs ſhould receive ſome Crown or Triumphal honour in Heaven. And if then be their <hi>evectio in Coelum,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſpeaks, how fitly does it fall in, that they ſhould then be inveſted in <hi>Heavenly</hi> bodies? Think ſeriouſly on that: <hi>Heaven</hi> is the fitteſt place for an <hi>Heavenly body,</hi> Is it not?</p>
               <p>But you'll ſay, If they be thus afore-hand cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Heavenly bodies, this ſeems to anticipate the general Day of Judgment, which our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.14. emphatically calls the <hi>Reſurrection of the Juſt:</hi> till which time the <hi>Crown</hi> or their being cloathed with <hi>Celeſtial bodies</hi> is a <hi>Depoſtium,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not expect from the hands of the righteous Judge till that day, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. viz. <hi>till the day of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,</hi> as is ſaid in the following words of the Text.</p>
               <p>But to theſe two places of Scripture I briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thus. To the firſt, That it rather implies a <hi>firſt Reſurrection</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> than contradicts it. For if it were meant of the day of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Reſurrection, our Saviour would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ſaid, the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>dead,</hi> than the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>juſt:</hi> But there being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed two diſtinct parts of time, the firſt when none but the juſt ariſe, the other when both juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, the former of theſe will naturally be called the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>juſt</hi> (by themſelves) as the other the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Reſurrection,</hi> or at large the <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the <hi>dead.</hi> Which former part, though it be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34043:97"/>moſt <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> yet other <hi>ſingularly</hi> ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified men, and that have the deepeſt dye of the Chriſtian Spirit in them, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> the fruits whereof our Saviour commends in that place <hi>Luke</hi> 14.13. may commence <hi>Coelicolae</hi> at the ſame time, and be inveſted with Heavenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Though a man give all away to the poor, and profeſs voluntary poverty himſelf, or give his body to be burnt, and have not this Spirit of Humility and Charity, he is nothing eſteemed. Therefore they that excel in theſe may well, with the Martyrs, have a ſhare in the firſt Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>This is one ſolid way of anſwering that place of Scripture. But it may be alſo briefly anſwered thus: That the <hi>Reſurrection of the juſt</hi> does not ſignifie there <hi>Individually,</hi> as I may ſo ſpeak, taken for ſome <hi>one ſolitary ſet time</hi> of their Riſing, but <hi>generally</hi> or at large, that <hi>when</hi> the <hi>juſt</hi> riſe, and receive their reward, this charitable man ſhall receive his amongſt them, whether at the <hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> or after the ending, it matters not ſo curiouſly to define, and ſo it ſeems to make neither <hi>pro</hi> nor <hi>con</hi> as to either Opinion.</p>
               <p>The other place, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. ſeems to pinch more ſorely: <hi>I have fought a good fight— Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them alſo that love his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</hi> This ſeems to imply that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall not have his Crown, a bleſſed Immortality in an Heavenly glorified body, till all the reſt of good Chriſtians that <hi>love</hi> the <hi>appearing of Chriſt</hi> ſhall have it.</p>
               <p>But in Anſwer to this I ſay, we are to conſider what is meant by this <hi>Day of Chriſt's appearing.</hi> And
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34043:97"/>there is nothing more obvious to obſerve in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, than that [a day] ſignifies as large as [time] let it be of what years you will. So that this <hi>Day of the appearing of Chriſt,</hi> may be the whole <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> or more, nay, reach from the beginning of the <hi>Millennium</hi> to the end of the World or Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For ſo long continues Chriſt's Kingdom on Earth when once it is begun in that eximious ſenſe after his Victory over the <hi>Dragon, Beaſt</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet.</hi> Read the 19. Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> Now this <hi>appearing of Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>glorious Reign</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom of his Saints</hi> is all one, as appears from the firſt verſe of this very Chapter: I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quick and the dead at <hi>his appearing and his Kingdom.</hi> The <hi>appearing</hi> mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 8. is the ſame with <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> with his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> The words in the Original are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Which may ſignifie in the time of his appearing and Kingdom, and may be an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and be rendred in the time of the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Kingdom, that Kingdom <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as I noted before, touching which are thoſe Voices, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. <hi>And I heard as it were the voice of a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, ſaying, Alleluia: For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</hi> In this Reign Chriſt will moſt gloriouſly and triumphantly adminiſter Juſtice, and moſt righteouſly order all affairs, whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>living</hi> or the <hi>dead.</hi> And then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Martyrs</hi> that ſuffered for Chriſt, they ſhall be raiſed firſt, and be inveſted in their glorified bodies. This affair will be diſpatch'd at the <hi>beginning</hi> of Chriſt's
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34043:98"/>Reign, but at the <hi>end</hi> all ſhall be raiſed, both good and bad, and receive according to their works: both theſe things will be done in <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame day,</hi> in the day of his Reign, which will be filled with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearances of his Power all along.</p>
               <p>And thus <hi>Paul</hi> might well ſay, and ſay truly: Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at <hi>that day,</hi> and not unto me only, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all them alſo that loved his appearing, that is, the appearing of his Kingdom in the power thereof, and daily prayed for it, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> as every good Chriſtian ought to do. <hi>Paul</hi> was to receive his Crown of righteouſneſs in the <hi>Morning</hi> of that long Day, others at the <hi>Evening</hi> or <hi>Cloſe</hi> thereof, but thus both receive it at <hi>that day,</hi> as receiving it both in the <hi>ſame</hi> day. Wherefore the difficulty of theſe two Texts being removed, I hope that part of my Expoſition, which takes the <hi>first Reſurrection</hi> in a <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, will ſeem now as eaſie, natural and agreeable as any of the other paſſages. Thoſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters that balk this obvious and natural ſenſe, and ſuch as the Primitive Chriſtians conceived of it, as you may ſee in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mede,</hi> keep a fearful pudder, and ſo flunder and confound all, that it is tedious to read them, much more would it be to write of them, or meddle with their Conceits. <hi>Rectum eſt Index ſui &amp; obliqui.</hi> And therefore I will give neither you nor my ſelf any unneceſſary trouble.</p>

               <head>CHAP.

               </head>
               <p>AS for that other Point in your Letter, which you rightly deem a leſs needful Curioſity, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the Jews be not to be converted by ſome miraculous way, ſuppoſe by <hi>Voice</hi> and <hi>Viſion</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> though not fully ſatisfied himſelf therein, is likely to give you the beſt ſatisfaction of any that I know. There are three places of Scripture that he takes notice of not impertinently. The firſt is <hi>Zach. Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>They ſhall ſee him whom they have pierced.</hi> Which Sentence, though conſidered alone, may ſeem to have little force in it; yet if you read it with the Context, which ſeems to predict and deſcribe the <hi>very Converſion of the Jews</hi> and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtate of the Chriſtian Church at that time, it will appear not a little to the purpoſe. Nor do I know how its force can eaſily be avoided, unleſs they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this ſeeing of him whom they have pierced, of the <hi>ſight</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> Which others haply will look upon but as a <hi>frigid</hi> evaſion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond place is <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 39. <hi>Ye ſhall not ſee me henceforth till you ſay, Bleſſed is he that cometh
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34043:99"/>in the Name of the Lord.</hi> This our Saviour ſpoke ſome few days before his Paſſion, and looking upon himſelf now as a dead man, and gone into the other World, he told the Chief Prieſts and Scribes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially (who, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21. rebuked the people for their Acclamations they made to him, <hi>viz.</hi> in thoſe words, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David, Bleſſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</hi> Which <hi>Grotius</hi> gloſſeth thus: <hi>Foelix ſit Rex à Deo nobis datus</hi>) that they ſhould ſee him no more till the time when they ſhould ſay, Bleſſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſhall ſay, <hi>Foelix ſit Rex à Deo nobis datus,</hi> and ſo acknowledge him their King and promiſed <hi>Meſſias.</hi> That this muſt be underſtood of ſeeing him again after his being gone into the other World is plain, becauſe it had not been true, if he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it of ſeeing him again before his death. For certainly they ſaw him at his Arraignment and Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion. Wherefore the words ſeem naturally to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſuch a ſeeing of him as S. <hi>Paul</hi> had by <hi>Viſion</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> whereby he was converted and forced to ſay, Bleſſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord, to recant his <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> and ſing <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to Chriſt the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and profeſs himſelf a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
               <p>And accordingly; which is the third place point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by Mr. <hi>Mede;</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) But for this very reaſon, ſays he, I (who out of ignorance had been a Blaſphemer, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuter and Injurer of Chriſt) obtained mercy, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that in <hi>me firſt</hi> (as the <hi>Primitiae</hi> of the Jewiſh Nation that is to be converted in ſuch a <hi>miraculous</hi> manner as I was) Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) but for a <hi>repreſentative Figure</hi> or <hi>Type</hi> of them, which ſhould hereafter believe on him to life everlaſting. This ſeems to be the natural ſenſe of the place. For why ſhould he ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in me firſt,</hi> if others were not to follow that ſhould be converted in ſuch a <hi>miraculous</hi> manner as <hi>he</hi> was by <hi>Viſion</hi> and <hi>Voices</hi> from Heaven? For in other ways of Converſion he was not the firſt of the Jews that were converted. Wherefore there muſt be a Converſion of the Jews by ſuch a mean as S. <hi>Paul</hi> was converted, and of which, the manner of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Converſion was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Prophetick Type</hi> or <hi>Figure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe three Scriptures may incline a rational man to believe that ſome chief of the Jews, the moſt able, the moſt noted, and moſt zealous of them for the Jewiſh Religion, may be called as <hi>Paul</hi> was. Whoſe Teſtimonies will awake all the Jewiſh Nation, and cauſe them more impartially to conſider the Truth of Chriſtian Religion; And the Completion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and their genuine Interpretation, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Diſcipline of the Church, and the lives of the Reformed Chriſtians, a ſort of them at leaſt may be ſo conſiderably perfected by that time (thoſe few Names in <hi>Sardis</hi> by that time being well increaſed) that things being ſo fitly prepared, it may ſeem a Miracle for any honeſt ſincere Jew in thoſe days not to be converted.

The Reinforcement of his Objection againſt the</hi> literal <hi>or</hi> phyſical <hi>ſenſe of the</hi> firſt Reſurrection, <hi>from two parallel places of</hi> Daniel <hi>and</hi> John. <hi>An Anſwer to that Reinforcement from thoſe very parallel places. The Genius of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Stile in</hi> Daniel <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>in intimating one</hi> Antitheton <hi>by another. What</hi> Antitheton <hi>to [thoſe awakened into Eternal life] in</hi> Daniel <hi>is to be found in the</hi> Apocalypſe. <hi>What is meant by the Devil's detruſion into the Abyſs. That the firſt Reſurrection is</hi> Phyſical, <hi>not</hi> Political, <hi>proved from the Text it ſelf,</hi> Apoc. 20. v. 4. <hi>That the Judgment there did paſs upon thoſe that were either</hi> naturally <hi>or</hi> politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally <hi>dead</hi> before <hi>the</hi> Millennium, <hi>when the wicked were not</hi> politically <hi>ſo, and therefore cannot be thoſe revived (in a</hi> Political <hi>ſenſe) after the</hi> Millennium. <hi>Further Arguments that the firſt Reſurrection is Phyſical.</hi>

I will ſet it down in your own words, that I may not diſadvantage the ſtrength of the ſenſe you aim at. You ask, Whether, ſince my ſelf make that place of <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 12. parallel to that of <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34043:100"/>
                  <hi>firſt Reſurrection</hi> mentioned there, by S. <hi>John,</hi> may not be underſtood rather in a <hi>Political</hi> ſenſe, of the ſtate of the Church in the <hi>Millennium,</hi> than in a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and <hi>Phyſical</hi> concerning the Martyrs? For [thoſe others] ſay you, in <hi>Daniel,</hi> which awake to ſhame and everlaſting contempt, perhaps may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> and the [awakening] there parallel to the [living] here, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whereas it is ſaid by S. <hi>John,</hi> The reſt of the dead lived not again till the thouſand years were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, what hinders, ſay you, but it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the wicked getting into Political power again after the expiration of the <hi>Millennium.</hi> That is briefly your ſenſe, if not your very words.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That though the attempt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious to object thus from thoſe two parallel places, yet the places themſelves that are parallel will jointly bear off the force of the Objection, and ſhow that a mere <hi>Political</hi> ſenſe for theſe places is harſh and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. For what can be more violent and harſh than to interpret, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in a <hi>Political</hi> ſenſe. This is the main place that the <hi>Jews</hi> alledge for their Article of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> in a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical</hi> ſenſe, as alſo the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the very Goſpel-phraſe again and again inculcated that ſignifies a bleſſed Immortality in a glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And beſides this, as <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.12. there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Books</hi> being <hi>opened</hi> at the <hi>general</hi> and <hi>Phyſical</hi> Reſurrection (as all well in their wits muſt needs underſtand it) ſo before <hi>this</hi> Reſurrection in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> there is mention of the <hi>Book,</hi> in which thoſe whoſe Names are written are to be <hi>ſaved,</hi> as it is ſaid <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.15. that thoſe whoſe Names are <hi>not found</hi> in the Book of <hi>Life</hi> were caſt into the Lake of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34043:101"/>fire. Theſe things conſidered, methinks, make it certain that the [awaking here in <hi>Daniel</hi> into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life] ſignifies not a <hi>Political,</hi> but <hi>Phyſical</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, let <hi>Porphyrius</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> phanſie what they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>And therefore in this parallel place of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, their living and reigning with Chriſt muſt have a <hi>Phyſical</hi> ſenſe, not a <hi>Political,</hi> and ſignifie their <hi>Vivification</hi> into <hi>celeſtial</hi> bodies, and their reigning with him in <hi>Heaven.</hi> And ſo thoſe that had not worſhipped the Beaſt, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his mark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they anſwer <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>in eodem genere,</hi> that is to ſay, in a <hi>Political</hi> ſenſe to thoſe that in <hi>Daniel</hi> are to be in ſhame and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contempt, one <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> implying the oppoſite thereto, and the oppoſite to that in <hi>Daniel</hi> is here made choice of in the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> For it is the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the Prophetick ſtile in theſe two Prophets, <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to intimate one <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I have obſerved ſeveral Examples, though I have not the command of them in my memory for the preſent. That in the Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> ſeems to be one inſtance, The <hi>beginning</hi> of the Creation of God, the <hi>Alpha:</hi> but his main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is to intimate thereby, that he is the <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>Ender</hi> or <hi>Finiſher</hi> of what he has begun. And ſo in the Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where he ſays, He that overcometh ſhall not be hurt of the <hi>ſecond death.</hi> This is no Priviledge of the <hi>Smyrnean</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, the ſame being common to all Chriſtians that are ſaved, but its <hi>Antitheton</hi> inſinuated by it, is; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>firſt Reſurrection</hi> oppoſed to the ſecond Death. There is yet a third comes into my mind, from what I noted above, moſt pertinent of all, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.15.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:34043:101"/>And if that any one was not found in the <hi>Book of Life,</hi> he was caſt into the <hi>Lake of fire.</hi> This is at the general Reſurrection plainly, where there is no mention made of the oppoſite party, the righteous and their Reward, but the <hi>Antitheton</hi> is to be fetched out of <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Every one that ſhall be found written in the Book</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhall be ſaved. So that <hi>Daniel</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> as touching ſuch <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, do as it were <hi>keep Tallies</hi> in ſeveral, which joined together, adjuſt the true ſenſe, and make the account clear and complete.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this Prophetick Ellipſis, by which one <hi>Antitheton</hi> being named we are to gather the other, ſhows how naturally in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> [thoſe that had not worſhipped the Beaſt nor his image reigned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] are ſet in oppoſition to [thoſe that are doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhame and everlaſting contempt] they being mere Underlings in the <hi>Millennial</hi> Reign of Chriſt, and ſo each of them underſtood in a <hi>Political</hi> ſenſe. And ſo we ſee from hence, that there is not any juſt ground for making a <hi>Political</hi> ſenſe of [thoſe that awake into eternal life] though [thoſe that are doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to everlaſting contempt] is to be underſtood <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litically,</hi> becauſe it reſpects another <hi>Antitheton</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> (and not that) which is immediately op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite <hi>in eodem genere.</hi> Let but <hi>Daniel</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> join Tallies, and the account will be clear.</p>
               <p>And now this it may be you will ſay were more eaſie to admit, if [thoſe that awake into everlaſting life] had ſomething alſo in <hi>eodem genere</hi> that were an <hi>Antitheton</hi> to it. But I have already proved, that have it or have it not, it is neceſſarily to be underſtood of a <hi>Phyſical</hi> Reſurrection, not <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:34043:102"/>
               <p>But for your greater eaſe, what if I ſhould allow that about that time that theſe <hi>Martyrs</hi> in the <hi>first Reſurrection</hi> are awakened into everlaſting life in their <hi>Heavenly</hi> bodies, and ſo aſcend into Heaven, that the Ghoſts of the cruel and barbarous Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (whether Pagan or Pagano-Chriſtian) of the Saints of God, together with their chief Inſpirers and Inſtigators thereto, thoſe Devils that were moſt active upon them for that work, ſhall be thruſt down into the nethermoſt Hell into that <hi>Dungeon</hi> of the <hi>Rephaim,</hi> which the Annotator upon <hi>Lux Orientalis</hi> deſcribes in his Annotations, if you have ſeen the Book? It's but interpreting the caſting the old Dragon and his Accomplices (the Ghoſts of that cruel murderous Crew of Perſecutors, whether Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gano-Chriſtian or Pagan) into the bottomleſs Pit, or rather Abyſs in a <hi>Phyſical</hi> ſenſe, and the buſineſs is done.</p>
               <p>I have in my Expoſition interpreted it in a <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> ſenſe, which therefore may anſwer to [thoſe which are doomed to ſhame and everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt]. Add but this <hi>Phyſical</hi> ſenſe; (And moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters take it in ſuch a <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, but being ignorant or mindleſs of a Prophetick <hi>Henopoeia</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, interpret it of <hi>one ſingle</hi> great Devil, and not in Conjunction with thoſe of his Kingdom of Darkneſs. But by a Prophetick <hi>Henopoeia,</hi> not only the Prince of the Devils, but all thoſe Devils and evil Spirits that were active in the Pagan and Pagano-Chriſtian Perſecutions may be here underſtood, and then their <hi>Phyſical</hi> detruſion into the <hi>Abyſs</hi> at this time is no mean Argument that thoſe whom they perſecuted were at the ſame time exalted into <hi>Heaven,</hi> that the other were thruſt down into the nethermoſt <hi>Hell,</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:34043:102"/>not able to get out thence till the <hi>Claviger</hi> of the <hi>Abyſs</hi> with his Miniſters brings them out again after the thouſand years to exerciſe the ſleepy <hi>Laodicean</hi> Church, but to be triumphed over in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was, who when he thought to have reduced the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> under his Bondage again, was overwhelmed with a Sea of <hi>Water,</hi> as <hi>Satan</hi> with all his numerous Forces, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in a <hi>Lake</hi> or Sea of <hi>Fire</hi>) Add, I ſay, but this <hi>Phyſical</hi> ſenſe to anſwer in oppoſition to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs aſcending into <hi>Heaven</hi> in their glorified bodies, while thoſe Wretches are thruſt down into the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt <hi>Hell,</hi> into the Abyſs, of which they are ſo much afraid <hi>Luke</hi> 8.31. and all is complete. And this impriſoning of theſe diſturbers of the World is very ſuitable, and fitly falls in with the peaceful and righteous Reign of Chriſt upon Earth. Thus much we have gained by conſidering the Text of <hi>Daniel,</hi> now let us caſt our eyes upon its parallel place in the <hi>Apocalypſe, Chap.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I ſaw the Souls of them that were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. Certainly this denotes them dead in a <hi>Phyſical</hi> or <hi>natural</hi> ſenſe, not <hi>Political,</hi> and in what ſenſe they are dead they muſt be ſaid to be revived, <hi>viz.</hi> in a <hi>Phyſical,</hi> unleſs we do manifeſt violence to the Text. Which ſame violence would be offered, if we did not interpret that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows [but the reſt of the dead lived not again till the thouſand years were finiſhed] in a <hi>Phyſical</hi> ſenſe too. From whence it follows likewiſe, that [This is the firſt Reſurrection] muſt have a <hi>Phyſical</hi> ſenſe alſo, not a <hi>Political,</hi> nor yet a <hi>Moral,</hi> and ſo will anſwer directly to [thoſe ſome awakened into everlaſting life] in <hi>Daniel.</hi> And thus the parallel places ſupport
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34043:103"/>the true ſenſe of each other. And then that which follows in the <hi>Apocalypſe, Bleſſed and holy is he</hi> (that is to ſay, Bleſſed in having a peculiar and ſeparate Priviledge above others in partaking of the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, he being already ſecure from the ſecond Death which is the Lake of Fire, from which none are actually ſecured till they obtain their Heavenly bodies) will have a natural and eaſie coherence with what preceded, as alſo a very fit reference to that paſſage of the Epiſtle to the Church in <hi>Smyrna</hi> (that interval of the Church wherein the Pagan Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did ſo rage, and there were ſo many <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> beheaded, or otherwiſe martyred for the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus) <hi>He that overcomes ſhall not be hurt by the ſecond death;</hi> which implies by that uſual <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> I ſpoke of above, that he ſhall be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the <hi>firſt Reſurrection,</hi> and enjoy that peculiar Priviledge for his Sufferings, according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Primitive Fathers.</p>
               <p>This hinders me from allowing that [The reſt of the dead lived not again till the thouſand years were finiſhed] may be underſtood of the wicked's revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Politically</hi> after the expiration of the <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium;</hi> and the rather, becauſe the ſenſe of the place carries it for thoſe that at the <hi>Millennium</hi> were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore <hi>dead,</hi> either <hi>naturally</hi> or <hi>Politically,</hi> (and ſo Judgment proceeds upon them <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.4.) <hi>which</hi> the wicked were not in a <hi>Political</hi> ſenſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> [they lived not again] muſt refer to that <hi>Phyſical</hi> Reſurrection we contend for.</p>
               <p>Add to all this, that if the <hi>firſt Reſurrection</hi> were underſtood in a <hi>Political</hi> ſenſe, and meant in general as well of them that were beheaded as thoſe that worſhipped not the Beaſt, and in no other ſenſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34043:103"/>than ſo, there is no reaſon why S. <hi>John</hi> ſhould uſe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> at firſt, and then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And we might demand, if that be the firſt <hi>Political</hi> Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is the ſecond? unleſs we will <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And how it can be appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this firſt Reſurrection as a ſpecial Priviledge of the partakers thereof, that the ſecond Death ſhall have no power over them, this by promiſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all true Believers, though not Martyrs, from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World. But to obtain a glorified body before the ſecond Death or the Lake of Fire be in being, which by its own Nature exempts from the harm thereof, or of any thing like it in being, this is a peculiar Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge indeed. And bleſſed and holy and peculiarly happy is he that has his ſhare in ſuch a firſt Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as this, for he is actually out of the reach of all harm that may come from the Lake of Fire, (the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the reach of whoſe power is to be obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to the ſecond Death) and according to the Apocalyptick <hi>Antithetical</hi> implications or intimations he is poſſeſſed already of everlaſting life in a glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body, whenas others are but <hi>Candidates</hi> for the ſame.</p>
               <p>I hope by this time you perceive how eaſie, ſmooth and natural my Expoſition of the <hi>firſt Reſurrection</hi> in a <hi>Phyſical</hi> ſenſe is, and how intricate, harſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex the contrary way would be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And ſo the City which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> deſcribes, by which is underſtood the <hi>Church on Earth,</hi> the twelve Gates, the River, Trees and Fruit, they are all tranſcribed into the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of this <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> So aſſured a thing is it, that the Apocalyptick Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> does denote a ſtate of the Church here on Earth.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it were a more fit thing to bring into view the Plea of the other Party, who are ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that it is a deſcription of the <hi>ſtate of Heaven,</hi> than to concern our ſelves in any further proofs that it is a ſtate of the <hi>Church on Earth,</hi> that we may give a right judgment of the matter. <hi>Alcazar,</hi> who is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtiff for this Opinion, produces no fewer than ſeven Arguments for the ſame.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the Authority of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who bluntly ſays in his <hi>De Civitate Dei, lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. That it is mere impudence to aſſert otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Abſterget Deus omnem lacrymam ab oculis eorum, &amp; mors jam non erit, ne<expan>

               <p>The ſecond is taken from the Order of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe,</hi> which having ſet down at the end of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapter a deſcription of the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and puniſhment of the Wicked, it neceſſarily follows that in the next place ſhould be ſet down a deſcription of the everlaſting glory and happineſs of the Elect in Heaven.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:34043:105"/>
               <p>The third is, from that it is ſaid <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 11. That the Heaven and the Earth fled away from the face of him that ſat upon the white Throne, and there was found no place for them, and this to have been in the laſt day of Judgment. Wherefore the <hi>New Heaven</hi> and the <hi>New Earth</hi> mentioned in the beginning of the next Chapter, foraſmuch as the Univerſe cannot be without an Heaven and Earth, muſt be the <hi>renewed</hi> Heaven and Earth <hi>after</hi> the Day of Judgment, in which the glorified Saints enjoy themſelves in their Heavenly ſtate, which is called the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth is taken from <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.7, 8. He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things, but the fearful and unbelieving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall have their part in the Lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death. Whence, ſays he, it is manifeſt, that it is the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Bliſs that is here promiſed to the Victor, and that this <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> therefore is a ſtate in <hi>Heaven, not on Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, The ſide of the Square <hi>Area</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s City by which the Church <hi>Militant</hi> is prefigured, is but four thouſand five hundred reeds or forty five furlongs; but the ſide of the Square of the <hi>Area</hi> of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> is extended unto twelve thouſand furlongs, which makes the <hi>Area</hi> of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> ſeventy one thouſand and an hundred and eleven times bigger than the <hi>Area</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s City, and therefore <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s City being the Church Militant, this <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> by reaſon of the vaſt difference in their capaciouſneſſes, and S. <hi>John</hi>'s City containing not the Elect of ſome one time, but of all Ages, muſt needs be the Church <hi>Triumphant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, Thoſe words, I ſaw no Temple there,

               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, In that it is ſaid, There is no Night, no Death, no Pain, no Curſe, That without are Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the Inhabitants of this City ſhall always enjoy the ſight of the Face of God and the Lamb, theſe are manifeſt indications that the ſtate deſcribed is not of the Church Militant, but Triumphant. Theſe are the notable Arguments of <hi>Alcazar,</hi> which <hi>Pareus</hi> alſo applauds or approves as ſtiff in <hi>Alcazar</hi>'s Opinion as himſelf. But I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them in order.</p>
               <p>To the firſt therefore I ſay, That the true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> being by Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence reſerved for theſe latter times, (as it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly intimated in <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 12.9.) As it is no diſparagement for the ancient Fathers not to be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in matters which the Wiſdom of God thought fit to conceal from them, ſo it is no rudeneſs or injury to their Authority, that it is not admitted in caſes wherein they are no competent Judges. They had not the advantage we have, who have ſo much of the Prophecies of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> ſo clearly fulfilled before our eyes; the fulfilling of Prophecies being the moſt certain Key for the opening of them. It is not likely that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> underſtood, that the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> is the <hi>Apoſtatized Church,</hi> that great <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Polity Antichriſtian</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> that was to be deſtroy'd by the pouring out of the <hi>Vials;</hi> upon the deſtruction whereof one of the <hi>Vial-Angels</hi> ſhowed this <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Polity</hi> the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>John,</hi> as <hi>that</hi> Power or Polity that was to ſucceed in the others room, in which the Servants of God that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34043:107"/>to the pure Goſpel, nor would ſubmit to the Roman Superſtitions and Idolatries, were cruelly perſecuted, tortured, and murdered many hundred thouſands of them, which could not be without the <hi>tears</hi> of them that were concerned. Theſe things, I ſay, S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> being ignorant of, we may well excuſe him for his confident miſtake: who, if he had known them, would have eaſily diſcerned the Speech to have been <hi>figurative,</hi> when it is ſaid, there ſhall be <hi>no more death,</hi> nor <hi>crying,</hi> nor <hi>ſorrow,</hi> nor <hi>pain,</hi> and that God will <hi>wipe all tears</hi> from their eyes, <hi>viz.</hi> that by a <hi>Synecdoche generis</hi> thoſe kinds of death, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, pain, crying and tears are pointed at that were cauſed by that <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Polity that ſo barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſecuted the Saints of God; that in this <hi>New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem ſtate</hi> they ſhould be free from theſe. Which is an eaſie and obvious ſenſe thus underſtood. And indeed the obſerving that the deſcription of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is in oppoſition to the <hi>Polity</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> which it ſucceeds, is a <hi>ſpecial Key</hi> for the rightly opening the meaning of the Deſcription all along, as may be obſerved in my <hi>Expoſition</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, (1.) That the Object of the <hi>opened Book-Prophecy,</hi> of which the Deſcription of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is part, is not the ſtate of the <hi>Church in Heaven,</hi> but the ſtate thereof on <hi>Earth.</hi> And therefore though a deſcription of the ſtate of the Church in Heaven would follow here handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet it being quite <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> to the nature of this Prophecy, we may be ſure it is not here deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed but a ſtate on Earth in the <hi>Millennium,</hi> and that therefore there is a going back into thoſe times in this Deſcription; the placing of the Viſions being no certain Argument of the order of time they belong
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:34043:108"/>to, as all know that know any thing in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, That there is an holy and happy ſtate of the Church of Chriſt in his <hi>Millennial</hi> Reign on <hi>Earth</hi> is plain, and that that State or <hi>Polity</hi> oppoſite to the <hi>Polity</hi> or City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is no where ſo fully deſcribed as the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> is, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. is as plain. Wherefore what can be more likely, than that this City the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is deſcribed as a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> oppoſite to the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was drunk with the blood of the Saints and the blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus, from which barbarous Perſecutions the Saints are ſecured in this <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate. Whence it is ſaid, <hi>There ſhall be no more death, nor ſorrow, nor crying, but that God will wipe all tears from their eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thoſe many paſſages noted in my <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> of this Deſcription of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> which is needleſs here to repeat, plainly demonſtrate it to be a deſcription of the ſtate of the Church on Earth.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, The <hi>Vial-Angel,</hi> the laſt doubtleſs, as being neareſt to this time that ſhews <hi>John</hi> the Bride, the Lamb's <hi>Wife,</hi> in oppoſition to the bloody <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> deſtroy'd by him under the ſeventh Vial, how naturally does his ſhowing <hi>John</hi> the <hi>City, New Jeruſalem,</hi> upon his having deſtroy'd the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> imply, that he ſhows him that <hi>Polity</hi> that is to ſucceed that of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that therefore this <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is here upon Earth.</p>
               <p>To the third I ſay, That that high expreſſion of the <hi>Heaven and Earth flying away,</hi> or vaniſhing from the face of him that ſate upon the Throne, and that there was found no place for them, is only to ſet out
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34043:108"/>the exceeding <hi>great Glory</hi> of him that ſate upon the Throne, that they could neither ſee Earth nor the Azure Sky, their eyes being ſo filled and taken up with the great reſplendency and brightneſs of that light. But the real ſtreſs of the Argument, if there be any in it, is, That there is a new Heaven and a new Earth after the <hi>Conflagration</hi> (which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the laſt Judgment) mentioned in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the enſuing Chapter. But from what has been faid to the ſecond Argument it is apparent, that it is a mere <hi>Lemmatoſynechia,</hi> that is, the continuing together of the Viſions in the outward <hi>Cortex</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> as if that were the very order of time in the things they prefigure, when it is quite otherwiſe in the true ſenſe of the Viſions. This is one part of the artifice of <hi>Concealment</hi> affected by the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> of which there are many inſtances; As that <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1. where after the Viſion of the ſeven Churches, <hi>John</hi> is bid to come up, that he might be ſhown what things muſt come to paſs <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, after theſe things. Which <hi>Lemmatoſynechia</hi> has ſo impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon ſome otherwiſe learned and of notable parts, that they have joined the beginning of the <hi>ſealed Book-Prophecy</hi> with the ending of the affairs of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> That alſo ſeems to be a <hi>Lemmatoſynechia, Chap.</hi> 13.14. where the two-horned Beaſt is ſaid to make an Image to the Beaſt that had the wound by the Sword and did live, as if the ten-horned Beaſt in the immediately foregoing Viſion were meant, which is a glib correſpondency in the <hi>Cortex</hi> when the inward ſenſe is otherwiſe. But there is not a more elegant <hi>Lemmatoſynechia</hi> than that <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.9. where the three days and an half of the Witneſſes being dead, are immediately placed after the twelve
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:34043:109"/>hundred and ſixty days of their mournful propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; when yet the three days and an half are the ſame time or Synchronal to the twelve hundred and ſixty days, as I have elſewhere proved by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable Arguments. I will only add one inſtance more, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19. where the City is ſaid to be <hi>divided</hi> into <hi>three parts</hi> upon the Earthquake there mentioned, whenas that <hi>Tripartition</hi> of the City was before, but it is a very ſmooth and trim <hi>Lemmato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynechia</hi> in the <hi>Cortex.</hi> And ſuch a <hi>Lemmatoſyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi> is this in naming a <hi>New Heaven</hi> and a <hi>New Earth</hi> immediately after the <hi>Conflagration,</hi> which is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſmooth connexion in the <hi>Cortex,</hi> when yet in truth, this <hi>New Heaven</hi> and <hi>New Earth</hi> is a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Heaven and Earth, anſwering to that of <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> 65.17. and created in the beginning of the <hi>Millennium.</hi> This is the promiſed <hi>New Heaven</hi> and <hi>New Earth</hi> mentioned by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> (alluding to that of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>) wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs, whenas the Polity of <hi>Babylon</hi> was full of perſecution, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and blood. Wherefore <hi>Alcazar</hi> being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of this uſual Artifice of <hi>Concealment</hi> intended in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> which I call <hi>Lemmatoſynechia,</hi> has produced that for a ſtrong Argument, which, the matter rightly underſtood, has no ſtrength in it at all.</p>
               <p>To his fourth I anſwer, That we are both agreed in this, that the 7. and 8. verſes of <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. reſpect the ſtate of men to come after the Day of Judgment, the <hi>Lake of fire,</hi> and the <hi>Inheritance</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> For I declare in my Expoſition, That from the ſecond verſe to the ninth is a brief deſcription of the affairs of the Church from the ſecond Thunder to the laſt, or to the end of the World, to the laſt Reward of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34043:109"/>Godly, and Puniſhment of the Wicked. But as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>brief</hi> mention of the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon, Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 19. there is a <hi>large</hi> deſcription of her and her deſtruction in the two following Chapters, 17. and 18. ſo here after a <hi>brief</hi> intimation of the emerſion of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> into being, there is a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> Deſcription thereof from the ninth verſe of this 21. Chapter to the ſixth of the next. And I may here further add, that as in the foregoing Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. the <hi>Conflagration</hi> is glanced at in the deſtruction of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> by fire, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged the holy City, but the Judgment of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and <hi>fiery Lake</hi> or <hi>Conflagration</hi> more fully proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>v.</hi> 11. to the end of the Chapter: So here after the <hi>brief</hi> mentioning of the ſtate of the <hi>New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> in the five firſt verſes, it is more fully deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed from the ninth verſe to the end of this Chapter, and ſome part of the next. So ſmall force has this fourth Argument to infer that theſe deſcriptions of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> belong to the ſtate of the <hi>Church in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth Argument makes a pretty ſhow, but it is grounded upon a groſs miſtake, as if the twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand furlongs were the ſide of the Square <hi>Area</hi> of the <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> whenas it is a ſolid Number, whoſe Cubick root multiplied by four, gives the ſame Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter in a manner that <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s four thouſand five hundred multiplied into four do give, that is, eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand, not <hi>Reeds,</hi> but <hi>Cubits,</hi> as both <hi>Gaſpar Sanctius</hi> and <hi>Villalpandus</hi> conceive them to be, both of them learned and induſtrious Commentators upon <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> By which ſolid account the ſeeming force of this fifth Argument quite vaniſheth. See Mr. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Interpretation of the Number 666. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. And
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34043:110"/>the Equality of Perimeters of the Square <hi>Area</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s and S. <hi>John</hi>'s Cities (ſuppoſing the ſolid meaſure of S. <hi>John</hi>'s City to be twelve thouſand fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, as the Text it ſelf ſeems to intimate, [and he meaſured the City with a Reed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in all twelve thouſand furlongs], and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thereupon adding, the length, breadth and height of it are equal, implies they are ſolid furlongs) this Equality, I ſay, added to the twelve Gates in each City, twelve Tribes, the River and the Trees and Fruit, is a plain Argument that S. <hi>John</hi>'s City and <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s are <hi>Figures</hi> of the ſame thing, and <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi>'s being of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church on Earth,</hi> S. <hi>John</hi>'s muſt be ſo alſo.</p>
               <p>And now for his ſixth Argument from, <hi>I ſaw no Temple there.</hi> It conſiſts very well with the ſtate of the Church in thoſe beſt and moſt glorious times thereof in the <hi>Millennial</hi> Reign of Chriſt, which the <hi>Cabbaliſts</hi> alſo call the <hi>Reign</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> when God will find, in abundance, ſuch Worſhippers as he ſeeks for, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as ſhall worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth. And this paſſage ſeems inſerted on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be a Key to the <hi>Jews</hi> that will then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, how to underſtand <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Prophecy of the ſame ſtate of the Church, by the City he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes and makes ſo much to do with the Temple and Rituals thereof; they will by this Note underſtand that it is an <hi>Hylaſtick</hi> Parable, of which the Truth is to be followed, and the ſhadow to fly away.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, For what is alledged in the ſeventh Argument, they are but ſuch things as are already anſwered by my anſwering the firſt, where I have explained in what ſenſe there is ſaid to be <hi>no death, nor ſorrow, nor pain.</hi> And it being ſaid there is no
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34043:110"/>
                  <hi>curſe,</hi> that is, no <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that reſpects the <hi>Papal</hi> Curſes, as is noted in my Expoſition. And that there is <hi>no Night,</hi> is no more than is ſaid by <hi>Eſay</hi> of the ſtate of the Church on Earth, <hi>Thy Sun ſhall no more go down,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 60. And this ſtate of the Church being ſo holy on Earth, it is no wonder that ſuch ill people as are called Dogs, Sorcerers, Whoremongers, Idolaters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are excluded from it, and not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into their Communion: And in that they are ſaid to enjoy the ſight of the face of God and of the Lamb; what is this more than what S. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we are capable of in this life? That God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, may ſhine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. So that there being ſo many indications, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in my <hi>Notes,</hi> that the deſcription of this <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is a deſcription of a ſtate of the <hi>Church on Earth,</hi> and the beſt Arguments alledged againſt it being really invalid, it remains manifeſt, that the ſtate of the Church in the <hi>Millennial</hi> Reign of Chriſt on the Earth is predicted and deſcribed by this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now after the pondering of the <hi>Plea</hi> of <hi>both</hi> Parties, though I am very confident, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is a deſcription of the <hi>Church on Earth</hi> in the <hi>Millennium,</hi> yet I am on the other ſide as confident of what is not at all repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to this, that this excellent <hi>Millennial</hi> ſtate of the Church is a <hi>Type</hi> (and ſo intended to be in its deſcription) of that more tranſcendently bleſſed and glorious ſtate of the Church <hi>Triumphant</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi> And the reaſons that induce me to this belief in brief are theſe.</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:34043:111"/>
               <p>Firſt, It ſeems handſom and congruous, that it being ſo univerſally acknowledged on all ſides, that the State and Oeconomy of the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> was a <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> which was to ſucceed it; ſo the beſt ſtate of the Chriſtian Church <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi> which is the <hi>Millennial ſtate</hi> or rather the ſtate of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> here deſcribed, which the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> ſtate <hi>ſucceeds,</hi> ſhould be a <hi>Type</hi> of the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church <hi>Triumphant</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a ſufficient lively Deſcription and ſenſible Repreſentation of the ſtate of the ſecond Death which ſucceeds the general Judgment, the Lake burning with brimſtone and fire; why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould there not be as lively, or rather more lively deſcription of the ſtate of Eternal life, to which the Godly are adjudged, as well as the Wicked to the other ſtate?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, therefore, The Deſcription of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> State or <hi>Polity,</hi> for it is the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Heaven immediately ſucceeding this Lake of fire in the very next Chapter under the very name of a <hi>new Heaven</hi> and a <hi>new Earth</hi> the ſame with the <hi>New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and this after the <hi>Conflagration,</hi> we are fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invited thereby to conclude, that the ſtate of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> on <hi>Earth</hi> is ſo deſcribed, that it is alſo a <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Triumphant Jeruſalem</hi> in Heaven. And thus far we will allow force in <hi>Alcazar</hi>'s ſecond and third Argument, that they may fairly warrant, in conjunction with other Conſiderations, the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> on <hi>Earth</hi> to be a <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Church Triumphant</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, This being a moſt <hi>Holy</hi> Book of <hi>Divine Viſions,</hi> and this of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> the laſt of the Viſions, what can be a more proper Viſion than this,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34043:111"/>that <hi>typifies</hi> alſo the glorious and bliſsful ſtate of the Saints in Heaven, to be the cloſe of all, and which not only this Book of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> but the <hi>whole Bible</hi> aims at?</p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly, It is obſervable, and I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it in my <hi>Myſtery of Godlineſs, Book</hi> 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. That in a Prophecy that may have a meaner fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the firſt, and is really intended for that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling, yet by reaſon of the high actuation of the Spirit of the Prophet, ſome expreſſions may come from him that much better fit the <hi>Antitype,</hi> than the <hi>Type</hi> in which the Prophecy is firſt fulfilled. This is ſo over and over again verified in the Prophecy <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical</hi> of our Saviour Chriſt, that it is needleſs pains to name any; And many ſuch inſtances alſo are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in the <hi>Typical</hi> Prophecies of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as that in the Prince of <hi>Type,</hi> &amp;c. Now this being ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in Predictions that are but <hi>Types,</hi> of what there will be a fuller completion; that there are ſtrokes in them that <hi>properly</hi> belong not (but only <hi>figuratively</hi>) to the <hi>Type,</hi> but to its <hi>Antitype,</hi> there being this very caſe in the deſcription of the <hi>New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> a Prophecy of the <hi>Millennial</hi> ſtate of the Church on Earth; that is to ſay, there being ſuch expreſſions therein that more <hi>naturally</hi> deſcribe the ſtate of Heaven, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> has well obſerved in the firſt Argument, and <hi>Alcazar</hi> in the laſt: the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Reſult of this Conſideration is this, That it is a <hi>Prophecy</hi> of ſuch a <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church on Earth,</hi> as is a lively <hi>Type</hi> withal of that <hi>tranſcendent</hi> Happineſs the Saints will find in <hi>Heaven,</hi> where there ſhall be, not only no more death, ſorrow, crying, tears, pain or torture from that bloody perſecutive Polity of <hi>Babylon</hi> (which are intimated by a <hi>Synecdoche Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>)
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34043:112"/>but abſolutely and properly (ſpeaking without a Figure) there ſhall be none of theſe things at all. Theſe are the Reaſons that move me to think, that though the deſcription of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> be a <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the bleſſed <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Chriſt on Earth,</hi> that yet it is withal a <hi>Type</hi> of the Joys and Glory of the Kingdom of Heaven, wherewith the Saints are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded after the Conflagration.</p>

               <p>FOraſmuch as I am fully perſwaded in my own judgment, that I have ſuggeſted in my <hi>Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apocalypſe</hi> touching that Volume of Divine Viſions is true, namely, that the <hi>whole</hi> in a manner conſiſts of <hi>three</hi> main <hi>Prophecies,</hi> which reach each of them from the beginning of the Church to the End of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Epiſtolar</hi> Prophecy to the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Prophecy, and the <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy, and of <hi>three Introductory</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>each</hi> of the <hi>three</hi> Prophecies having prefixed to it <hi>one.</hi> And becauſe this is ſo fundamental a Truth, that no man with ſucceſs can interpret any part of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> repugnantly thereto, yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certainly and experimentally, that men of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Wit and Parts, and of a Genius to theſe kind of ſtudies, have notwithſtanding overlooked this neceſſary Principle, and thereby have bewildred themſelves, and loſt themſelves in inextricable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths; therefore for the more ſure inculcating ſo <hi>ſound</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> a Notion, I have thought fit ſomething more fully here to inſiſt on the proof thereof; but more eſpecially that thoſe three Viſions prefixed to theſe three Prophecies, are rather <hi>Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions</hi> to the ſaid Prophecies, than <hi>Prophecies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, I have in my <hi>Expoſition</hi> demonſtrated by no Ieſs than twenty ſolid Arguments, which are alſo ſet down at the end of my <hi>Expoſition</hi> of the <hi>Viſions</hi> of

                  <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the ſcope thereof is enforced by Notes thereon. But that it is a Prophecy reaching from the beginning of the Church to the End of the World, that one Conſideration might aſſure any one that is not hoodwinkt with prejudice, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe Seven Churches imply <hi>ſeven Intervals</hi> from the beginning of the Church (as any will grant that is convinced it is a Prophecy) and the Number <hi>Seven</hi> every where in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> implies <hi>All</hi> from the <hi>Terminus</hi> whence the Reckoning is, and therefore it neceſſarily implies <hi>all</hi> the intervals of the Church from the beginning to the end thereof. This muſt be indubitable to him that underſtands the ſtile of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> And taking this ground, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the intervals we have choſen, and applying Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory to each of them, the Epiſtles are found an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite</hi> Prefiguration of the things in each interval, and the <hi>Paronomaſtical</hi> alluſions hugely expreſſive of the Events of every interval, which is as full a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation as one can deſire, that the <hi>Epiſtolar</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy reaches from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>And now that the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Prophecy does ſo too, it is evident from the ſame Argument drawn from the <hi>Septenary,</hi> which is an <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Symbol of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality,</hi> taking in from the term it commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all the ſpace of mundane Affairs wherein the Church may be concerned, and Divine Providence and Prophecy imployed, which therefore is to the end of the World. And thus not only the <hi>ſeven Seals</hi> reach to the end of the World, but by the ſame reaſon the <hi>ſeven Trumpets</hi> commencing with the <hi>ſeventh Seal</hi> and <hi>ſeven Thunders</hi> commencing with the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> muſt reach to the end of the World.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34043:114"/>And the Angel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. ſwears to this Truth, That there ſhall be no more time, ſaving that wherein the ſeventh Angel ſhall ſound, and the Myſtery of God be finiſhed, as I ſhall make good afterwards. Wherefore here is abundance of Evidence, that the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Prophecy reaches from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>And that the <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy does the like, that is, reaches to the end of the World, is manifeſt, becauſe it reaches to the <hi>laſt Judgment</hi> and <hi>Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Chap.</hi> 20. And that the Viſions of <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. reſpect the beginning of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Childbirth, and the Fight of <hi>Michael</hi> with the <hi>Dragon,</hi> no man of common ſenſe can deny. From whence yet it will naturally follow, That the meaſuring of the Temple of God and the Altar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> reſpects alſo or reaches the beginning of the Church, for the Church was <hi>Symmetral</hi> as ſoon as it began. But theſe three Points there was leſs need to inſiſt upon, they being ſufficiently made out elſewhere.</p>
               <p>The chief thing intended here is to prove, that the <hi>three Viſions prefixed</hi> to theſe three main Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, are <hi>Introductions</hi> only to thoſe Prophecies, and not <hi>properly</hi> Prophecies themſelves. For the better clearing this Truth, we will take our riſe from the Title of the Book comprized in <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>The Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which God gave unto him to ſhew unto his ſervants things which muſt ſhortly come to paſs, and he ſent and ſignified</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the things to come to paſs, ſome ſooner, ſome later) <hi>by his Angel to his ſervant John.</hi> Here we ſee how metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically in a plain vulgar ſtile is ſet down the ſumm of this Book, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Book is a Book <hi>predicting things to come,</hi> that is to ſay, a <hi>Book of Prophecies.</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:34043:115"/>That this Book of Prophecies is a <hi>Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that he is the <hi>Revealer</hi> of theſe things <hi>to come,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> unto <hi>John</hi> by <hi>Angelical</hi> Miniſtry; But that the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus had this Revelation <hi>from God,</hi> it being the high Priviledge of the Soul of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to have ſuch Secrets revealed unto him. The two main things therefore included in this Title are theſe: That this Book is a <hi>Revelation</hi> of things <hi>to come:</hi> That this Revelation is <hi>from</hi> the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt, or through the Humanity of Chriſt, but by the <hi>Gift</hi> of the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Godhead.</hi> Both theſe things are ſet down here in an ordinary vulgar ſtile. But foraſmuch as thoſe Predictions in the three main Prophecies, which might have been made alſo or expreſſed in ſuch a vulgar plain ſtile, but yet are not but in <hi>pompous</hi> and <hi>Aenigmatical</hi> Phraſes, it was very ſuitable and congruous, that the ſignifying that theſe three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies were the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Man</hi> Jeſus Chriſt by the <hi>gift of God,</hi> ſhould be expreſſed with <hi>corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent Pomp</hi> and Magnificency. And this is the thing I contend for, that thoſe Viſions prefixed to theſe three main Prophecies, that the main deſign of them is to intitle the ſucceeding Prophecy to the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by the <hi>gift of God,</hi> and that the Godhead is joined with him in every one of theſe three Introductory Viſions, and ſo makes good that part of the general Title of the whole Book, and in as <hi>magnificent</hi> a manner as the Prophetical part it ſelf is ſet out therein.</p>
               <p>That there are ſuch <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſions prefixed before eminent Prophecies, is obſervable in very illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Examples thereof. As <hi>Iſai. Chap.</hi> 6. I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a Throne high and lifted up, and his train filled the Temple. Above ſtood the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims,</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:34043:115"/>&amp;c. Which Viſion is no Prophecy, but a ſignification of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s <hi>Miſſion</hi> and <hi>Inſpiration</hi> from God, whereby he was inabled to utter <hi>infallible</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies. The like Introductory Viſion and more ample of the glory of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> enthroned above the <hi>Cherubims</hi> is prefixed before <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Book of Prophecies, but is <hi>no Prophecy</hi> it ſelf, but a ſign of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> his <hi>Call</hi> and <hi>Inſpiration</hi> from God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie: He upon the Throne ſpeaking to him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.3. and ſaying, Son of man, I ſend thee to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. there's his <hi>Miſſion,</hi> and then reaching him a <hi>roll of a Book to eat,</hi> whereby (as <hi>John, Apoc.</hi> 10. doing the like) he was inabled to propheſie. I will add a third Example out of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> of that Viſion of an Angel habited like <hi>Aaron</hi> the High-Prieſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.5. prefixed before the Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> who communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Daniel</hi> the ſaid Prophecy. But now as no man is ſo ſenſleſs as to take thoſe <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſions in <hi>Iſaiah, Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> to be <hi>proper</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but only or chiefly ſignifications of the <hi>Divine Inſpiration</hi> of thoſe Prophets, that they were <hi>inabled</hi> thus to propheſie by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord: So it is a wonder to me, that any one of wit and parts and learning ſhould be ſo heedleſs and groſly miſtaken as to make any of theſe <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſions to the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolar</hi> Prophecy, the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Prophecy and the <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy, to be Prophecies <hi>properly</hi> ſo called, and not <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſions (ſuch as thoſe in <hi>Daniel, Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi>) whoſe proper ſcope is to intimate the <hi>Divine Inſpiration</hi> of <hi>John</hi> in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe Prophecies, which were communicated to him by <hi>Angelical</hi> Miniſtry upon the <hi>appointment of Chriſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>Merit</hi> obtained this <hi>Revelation</hi> from
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34043:116"/>the <hi>Eternal Godhead.</hi> That this is the genuine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe three <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſions I ſhall now endeavour to make good in order as they lye.</p>
               <p>And it is exceeding manifeſt in the firſt, that the Appearance to <hi>John</hi> of one in the <hi>Pontifical</hi> Habit, like that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> is hugely like that Appearance to <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 10.5. Wherefore why ſhould this be more a Prophecy than that? But both theſe Appearances being in the High Prieſts Habit, who was a <hi>Type</hi> of Chriſt, it is a plain Argument that it is <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> that appeared or was repreſented in both places. And this very Appearance <hi>dictating</hi> the Epiſtles (ſent to the ſeven Churches) unto <hi>John,</hi> as if he were his <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> or <hi>Secretary,</hi> and theſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles being the <hi>Epiſtolar Prophecy</hi> it ſelf, it is plain that it is the firſt part of the <hi>Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt ſignified to his Servant John.</hi> And that God is here in Conjunction with Chriſt, is manifeſt from his <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical</hi> Habit, which is a Symbol of the viſible World; as <hi>Philo</hi> takes notice, though he knew not the right Syſtem thereof. But what an excellent Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick thoſe <hi>Aaronical</hi> Habiliments are of the true <hi>Pythagorick</hi> Syſtem thereof I have abundantly made out in the <hi>Appendix to the Defence</hi> of my <hi>Philoſophick Cabbala, Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3, 4. See alſo the Latine <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> thereon. Wherefore the Aſſiſtance of the Eternal Divinity to the Soul of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> or Humanity of Chriſt, is hence eaſily conceived.</p>
               <p>And the like may be obſerved in that Viſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed before the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Prophecy contained in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4, and 5. It is no more a Prophecy than the Viſion prefixed before <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Book of Prophecies, and the leſs likely, it being in a manner the ſame Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with it. And therefore why ſhould it be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:34043:116"/>more here than there? Nay, if it be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of any King or Queen ſitting on their Throne in Chriſtendom, it is a very ancient Prophecy of them indeed. For that Viſion in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is the very ſame which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Elders ſaw on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Some intimation thereof is from the mention of the <hi>Sapphir</hi> ſtone on which he is ſaid to ſtand in the one, and to ſit in the other; but there is that which is yet more preſſing. For as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſays of his Viſion, that it was the <hi>Appearance of the glory of the Lord, Chap.</hi> 1.28. and the glory of <hi>the God of Iſrael, Chap.</hi> 10.19. ſo it is ſaid <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. that the glory of the Lord abode on <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi> Which therefore what it was is amply indicated in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which I doubt not but is a <hi>Symbol</hi> of the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and inviſible Kingdom of the <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> where he ſits enthroned amidſt his bright Angelical Squadrons, and the Pſalmiſt briefly notes, The Chariots of God are twenty thouſands, even many thouſands of Angels, the Lord is among them as in <hi>Sinai:</hi> where there was the Repreſentation of his Glory and Majeſty in his Angelical Kingdom, and 'tis likely on a <hi>Sapphir</hi> Throne, whoſe very <hi>Scabellum</hi> was alſo <hi>Sapphir,</hi> and ſo his feet (which is all from the Hip to the Toes) reſted on <hi>Sapphir.</hi> For to phanſie him ſtanding does not ſo well agree with the <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation</hi> of <hi>Majeſty.</hi> But the ſtrongeſt Argument is yet behind, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Cherubims</hi> and the order of the Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> anſwer ſo exquiſitely to this Viſion of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> Whence it muſt be plain to him that will ſee, <hi>Moſes</hi> being to order all things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Pattern</hi> in the Mount, that the order of the Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the Tabernacle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Repreſentation of the Glory of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34043:117"/>God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> on the <hi>Mount</hi> in his <hi>Spiritual Kingdom.</hi> To the perfection whereof it being not the Lot of the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> to reach, they bore not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the <hi>external</hi> and <hi>Ritual figure</hi> thereof in the order of their Camp, Tabernacle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Viſion in the Mount again ſeen by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and laſtly here by S. <hi>John</hi> with ſome few alterations only, and prefixed before his Prophecy of the <hi>Sealed Book,</hi> as it is before <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Book of Prophecies, how awkward a thing is it to conceit this a <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>formal</hi> Prophecy it ſelf, of the ſame nature that the three main Apocalyptick Prophecies are? whenas it is of no other nature than the Viſion prefixt before the <hi>Epiſtolar</hi> Prophecy, ſome parts of which Viſion are made uſe of in the <hi>Epiſtolar</hi> Prophecy it ſelf, as there is of this in the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Prophecy. And as that Viſion being a Repreſentation of Chriſt in Conjunction with his Church, may have ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and leſs diſtinct ſignificancies of her condition: ſo this Viſion prefixt before the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it being really a <hi>Symbol</hi> of the <hi>Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of the <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> may be ſo framed as to have ſome glances on thoſe times when this <hi>Spiritual Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>God of Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> (which is the chief aim of all) ſhall deſcend thence <hi>from God,</hi> and be found on Earth in the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate of his Church. This being the great ſcope of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in both the <hi>Sealed</hi> and <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, it is not irrational to conceive this ancient Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſeen by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> to be ſo attempered in this ſeen by S. <hi>John,</hi> as to have ſome glances at thoſe moſt excellent times, of which the <hi>Spiritual Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>God of Iſrael</hi> is the <hi>Archetypon,</hi> and it being ſo, it is <hi>prefigurative</hi> of them <hi>naturally</hi> of it
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34043:117"/>ſelf. But the <hi>ſpecial</hi> intention of prefixing it here, is to ſignifie in this magnificent manner, that the <hi>Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Book</hi>-Prophecy is the <hi>ſecond part</hi> of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Man Jeſus Chriſt</hi> which <hi>God gave him.</hi> For it is plain, that the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus ſignified by the <hi>Lamb</hi> that was ſlain, took the Book out of the right hand of him that ſate upon the Throne, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.7. which is the <hi>Eternal Godhead,</hi> and opened the Seals in order <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. and ſo communicated the Viſions of each Seal to <hi>John,</hi> a thing which no Creature in Heaven nor Earth nor under the Earth was found worthy or able to do beſides him. This therefore is the <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> defign of prefixing this <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Kingdom of the <hi>God of Iſrael</hi> before the <hi>Sealed Book</hi> Prophecy; which yet is ſo attempered, as I ſaid before, that the parties repreſented in it; ſeem to exhibit a <hi>Dramatical</hi> ſhow that hath a <hi>prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative</hi> ſignification of the Happineſs of the <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> ſtate of the Church. For it is the priviledge of the <hi>Angelical Kingdom,</hi> that they can exhibit <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical</hi> Shows or Plays, when we <hi>Mortals</hi> can only exhibit <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> ones. Wherefore, though the more ſpecial end of this Viſion is that which has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared, and ſuch in a manner as of that in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> yet the thing ſo naturally bearing it, nothing hinders but that it may have a kind of <hi>general</hi> Prefigurativeneſs of the Joy and Glory of Chriſt's Kingdom in the <hi>Millennium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now for the <hi>third Introductory</hi> Viſion prefixt before the <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy, That the ſpecial intent thereof is the ſame with the two former <hi>Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory</hi> Viſions, <hi>viz.</hi> to intimate that this third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> which <hi>God</hi> gave him, may appear from hence; In that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34043:118"/>underſtood by this <hi>Angel.</hi> Which Title or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation cannot be thought too mean for him, when he is repreſented and called a <hi>Lamb</hi> before. Beſides, in <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> 9. he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And in <hi>Malachy, Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Angelus Foederis.</hi> And Chriſt that led the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> bears the Title of an <hi>Angel</hi> ſometimes, and under this Title and Garb he has appeared unto ſome of the Patriarchs. Wherefore there can be no ſcruple but for all that he is called an <hi>Angel</hi> he may be <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And that he is <hi>really</hi> Chriſt, may appear from comparing <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7. with <hi>Apoc.</hi> 10 5, 6. where both theſe Angels do the ſame thing. But he in <hi>Daniel</hi> is Chriſt, as has been proved from his <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronical Habit,</hi> which no <hi>Angel</hi> can appear in not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining the perſon of Chriſt. Beſides, it is ſaid that his <hi>Face</hi> was as the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is like that <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.16. And his countenance was as the Sun ſhining in its ſtrength, which is ſaid there of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> And his feet like Pillars of fire anſwer to his feet like fine Braſs burning in a Furnace, and Pillars will anſwer to the ſtrength of Braſs. And laſtly, the <hi>Rainbow</hi> over his head is an infallible token (taken out of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and that of S. <hi>John</hi> here again) of the glory of the God of <hi>Iſrael, viz.</hi> Chriſt, according as S. <hi>John</hi> ſays, He came to his own, and his own received him not. Furthermore, there being the <hi>unſealed</hi> or <hi>opened Book</hi> in his Hand, which the <hi>Lamb</hi> received and opened, it is the moſt eaſie and natural to conceive that the Book remained with the ſame party now transformed into another ſhape. Add alſo that his ſpeech doth bewray him, (that is, his roaring like a Lion) that he is the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as he is called <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.5. Theſe congruities muſt needs
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:34043:118"/>perſwade any one that is not over-tough or ſtiff, that this <hi>Angel</hi> is really <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And then it natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, that <hi>John</hi> receiving this <hi>opened Book</hi> of this Angel, and by eating thereof being enabled to propheſie before many Peoples, Nations, Tongues and Kings, that this <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy is alſo the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> which he received of <hi>God,</hi> for he took the Book from him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. and here ſignifies the things therein contained to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>John</hi> in the Viſions following.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that this <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſion to the <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy ſerves the ſame end that the other two <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſions do, and is therefore of the ſame nature with them, not a Viſion that ſets out any particular affairs, though it may have ſome more <hi>general</hi> Preſignificances of the ſtate of things in the times it may thus preſignifie, as the <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſion to the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Prophecy has touching the <hi>Millennium.</hi> And that <hi>roaring</hi> of the Angel like a <hi>Lion,</hi> to ſupply the place of the ſeventh Trumpet, and the ſeven <hi>Thunders</hi> uttering their voices the mean time (whereby they naturally divide the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> into <hi>ſeven Intervals,</hi> as the <hi>ſeven Trumpets</hi> do the <hi>ſeventh Seal</hi>) this <hi>Roaring</hi> and <hi>Thundering</hi> has a <hi>preſignificancy</hi> in <hi>general</hi> of the Calamities and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that will befal that Party that this roaring and thundering is againſt during the ſpace of the ſeventh Trumpet: So that this <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſion is a kind of <hi>Tranſitionary</hi> Introduction to the <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy, and diſpatches the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Prophecy with that <hi>general</hi> Account of the <hi>Roaring</hi> of that Lion-like Angel, and of the <hi>ſeven Thunders</hi> during that <hi>Roaring,</hi> which fill up the ſpace of the ſeventh Trumpet, and conſequently of the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:34043:119"/>that ſo there might be an orderly proceeding to the <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy, the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy reaching to the end of the World, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Oath of the Angel, as I promiſed to make out, which I do thus.</p>
               <p>This roaring of the mighty Angel is put in the place of the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt occupy the ſame ſpace of time with it, or be Synchronal thereto. And that it ſupplies the place of the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, is manifeſt from that it immediately follows the ſixth, and alſo is diſtinguiſhed into <hi>ſeven Thunders,</hi> as the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Seal is into <hi>ſeven Trumpets.</hi> This may aſſure any one that is not blinded with prejudice, that the roaring of this mighty Angel ſupplies the place of the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, and conſequently that it is Synchronal thereto. But now foraſmuch as <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.6, 7. that Oath of the Angel in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is maimed ſenſe or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, if <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the true tranſlation of this Oath is this: That there ſhall be no more time, ſaving in the days of the Voice of the ſeventh Angel when he ſhall ſound, and the Myſtery of God be finiſhed. This is certainly the true and genuine ſenſe of the Oath of the Angel according to the Original Text, as is more fully proved in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Remarks.</hi> But it is plain from this Oath of the Angel, that the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet reaches to the end of the World. Therefore the roaring of the Angel Synchronal thereto, reacheth to the end of the World, and conſequently the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Prophecy
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:34043:119"/>reacheth thither alſo, which is the thing that was to be demonſtrated. And it ſuits mighty well with the laſt Thunder reaching to the end of the World, which falls in with the <hi>Conflagration</hi> or Lake of Fire, and with the <hi>Exit</hi> of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> interval, ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in alluſion to <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">

That this Book its being ſaid to be written</hi> within <hi>and</hi> without, <hi>denotes a</hi> twofold <hi>ſenſe, that of the</hi> Symbolical <hi>Letter, and that of the inward</hi> Prophetical <hi>meaning of thoſe</hi> Symbols. <hi>Arguments to prove this to be the right ſenſe of being writ</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>and</hi> without. Ezekiel<hi>'s Roll writ</hi> within <hi>and</hi> without, <hi>compared with this</hi> Seven-ſealed <hi>Book of the</hi> Apocalypſe. <hi>Three uſeful Conſectaries deduced therefrom.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is a matter of no ſlight moment to underſtand clearly and aſſuredly what is the right meaning of the <hi>Book</hi> (in the right hand of him that ſits upon the Throne, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5.) its being ſaid to be writ <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> to be <hi>Liber Opiſthographus.</hi> In order to which we are firſt to take notice what was the faſhion of the Books of the Ancients, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were one Membrane, ſome longer, ſome ſhorter, rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon a round ſtick, or ſome ſtiff thing, as we ſometimes do Maps. Which makes me conceive, that this <hi>Book</hi> with <hi>ſeven Seals</hi> conſiſted of at leaſt <hi>twice</hi> ſeven ſuch Membranes, Parchments or Papers faſtned together ſo at one end, that it might be ſtiff enough to have all thoſe leaves of paper rolled about
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:34043:120"/>it. And, I ſay, there muſt be at leaſt <hi>twice</hi> ſeven, that no more Writing may be ſeen than what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to each Seal in their order by opening. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is to be a <hi>leaf</hi> of paper with a <hi>Label</hi> at it to cover the leaf that has the Viſion of the firſt Seal, and then another leaf with a Label at it to cover the leaf of the Viſion of the ſecond Seal, and ſo a <hi>Label-leaf</hi> before the <hi>Viſion-leaf</hi> till you come to the Number of ſeven in each, that no more of the Writing may be ſeen at a time than what belongs to each preſent Seal, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the laſt, where you breaking open the <hi>Seal</hi> that belongs to the ſeventh <hi>Label,</hi> not only the Viſion of the <hi>ſeventh Seal</hi> is diſcoverable, which are the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Trumpets and the ſeven Thunders, but all the Viſions of the <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy. So that there muſt be as many <hi>leaves</hi> without <hi>Labels</hi> placed after the ſeventh <hi>Label-leaf,</hi> as will ſerve to contain <hi>all</hi> the Viſions of the <hi>ſeven Trumpets,</hi> and alſo all the <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy. Which muſt be ſome number of leaves, though writ within and without <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>within</hi> and on the <hi>back-ſide,</hi> as the foregoing <hi>Viſion-leaves</hi> are conceived to be, that is, written on the <hi>concave</hi> and <hi>convex</hi> ſide of this Roll of leaves. And thus in the breaking open the Seals, the <hi>convex</hi> ſide of the <hi>Viſion-leaf</hi> will occur firſt, in every unſealing.</p>
               <p>This I conceive is the moſt probable <hi>Mechanical</hi> frame of this Book written <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> and <hi>ſealed</hi> with <hi>ſeven Seals.</hi> But what this Book is a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of, there is a wide difference amongſt Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The generality of the Ancients, as <hi>A Lapide</hi> has noted, take it to be the <hi>Bible,</hi> and that which is writ <hi>without</hi> to be the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and that <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> the New, the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> being as it were the <hi>Velamentum</hi> or <hi>Covering</hi> of the <hi>New.</hi> Or that which
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34043:121"/>is writ <hi>without</hi> to be the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, that <hi>within,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Myſtical.</hi> But this general Conceit of the Ancients is but a general Miſtake, becauſe this Book was ſealed up till the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to S. <hi>John,</hi> which was at the end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Reign, and therefore would imply that the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> or <hi>Goſpel</hi> were a <hi>ſealed Book</hi> not to be underſtood till then. Which yet certainly the Apoſtles underſtood, and taught the people rightly to underſtand it, ſo that it was no <hi>ſealed Book</hi> to them. But that this <hi>ſealed Book</hi> is a Book that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all the Prophetick Viſions ſet down after the opening of it in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> is ſo exceeding plain, that it would amaze a man how it ſhould come into the thoughts of ſo many of the Ancients, that <hi>this Book</hi> with <hi>ſeven Seals</hi> ſhould be the <hi>entire Bible,</hi> whenas it is not ſo much as the <hi>entire Apocalypſe,</hi> but contains only the <hi>ſealed Book,</hi> and the <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecies, but that the being written <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> intimates a <hi>literal</hi> and <hi>myſtical</hi> ſenſe of the Book, how near they come to the Truth therein, we ſhall obſerve in the main Point we drive at.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I cannot but approve of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius A Lapide</hi>'s Verdict in the Caſe, who ſays, <hi>Liber hic non eſt aliud quàm Divinae Providentiae conſilium &amp; praefinitio,</hi> &amp;c. This Book is nothing elſe but the Counſel and Determination of Divine Providence, whereby God has purpoſed with himſelf either to permit or effect things in the World wherein his Church is concerned in ſuch a way as is prefigured in this Book of Prophecies. Which is to the ſame ſenſe that the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> to <hi>S. E.</hi> has declared touching the Prophecy of the <hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> that it is what is decreed and recorded in the Divine Mind. The
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34043:121"/>ſtanding Intellect of God, in which are deſcribed all the Laws and Decrees of his Providence, is that <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> or <hi>Book of God,</hi> which is ſo often mentioned in the Bible, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56. and 139. And this Book repreſented to <hi>John</hi> ſealed and unſealed, is but a <hi>Symbol</hi> of <hi>part</hi> of <hi>this Book</hi> or Writing, as I may ſo ſpeak. And to the <hi>Scripture of Truth</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> as well as to the Roll in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> in all likelihood may this Apocalyptick <hi>ſealed</hi> and <hi>unſealed Book</hi> allude.</p>
               <p>And now to come more near to the main Point in hand, though I have given ſuch a <hi>Mechanical</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this <hi>ſealed Book</hi> written <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> yet I am ſtill utterly of the mind of the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> to <hi>S. E.</hi> his <hi>Remarks, Apoc. Chap.</hi> 5. that it is a childiſh thing to think that the <hi>Book</hi> ſeen by <hi>John,</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with all thoſe words contained in that part of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> but it was a Symbol of the Compages of thoſe <hi>Prophetical Repreſentations</hi> and of the <hi>inward meaning</hi> of them contained in the Mind of Chriſt and the holy Angel ſent to <hi>John.</hi> And that as the <hi>Book</hi> in <hi>general</hi> was a Symbol of the <hi>figurative Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and the <hi>inward meaning</hi> of them (in the mind of the Angel) or of the inward Prophetical ſenſe of them, ſo the being writ <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifies the <hi>latter</hi> the <hi>external</hi> Repreſentations or Symbols of the Prophecies, and the being writ <hi>within</hi> the <hi>real Prophetick ſenſe</hi> of thoſe <hi>Figures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this is the neceſſary ſenſe of this Book's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>writ within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> may appear from hence, becauſe there is no evaſion from it, but ſuppoſing the Viſions and Prophecies ſo large, that the <hi>inſide</hi> or <hi>concave</hi> ſide of this Roll of papers would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, to denote the exuberancy or fulneſs of this Spirit of Prophecy, as that of Poetry.</p>

               <p>This is the general account of Interpreters, which is a very lank, empty, and an uſeleſs account. But this intimation of thoſe two ſenſes I have noted is <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>weighty,</hi> the wildneſs and vanity of thoſe Interpreters being diſcovered thereby that confound the <hi>Symbolical</hi> ſenſe with the <hi>real</hi> or <hi>Prophetical,</hi> as <hi>R. H.</hi> has done. See my <hi>Epilogue</hi> to my <hi>Expoſition of the Apocalypſe,</hi> Sect. 10. And there are thoſe ſo weak, as to give credit to his Expoſitions. Whence we ſee how <hi>needful</hi> it was to give this intimation for this <hi>twofold</hi> ſenſe of this Book, and worthy the Spirit of Prophecy ſo to do.</p>
               <p>But that this being writ <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without</hi> is not ſaid in regard of the exuberancy of the matter or ſcantneſs in the <hi>concave</hi> ſides of the Viſion-papers to contain it all, may appear from that neceſſary <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical</hi> account I have given of this <hi>ſeven-ſealed</hi> Roll, if any <hi>Mechanical</hi> account is to be lookt after. For the largeſt of the Viſions of the firſt ſix Seals are ſo little, that they cannot well be conceived to fill ſo much as one ſide, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Concave</hi> of each <hi>Viſion-paper.</hi> Wherefore how can the exuberancy of the matter cauſe them to be writ as well on the <hi>convex</hi> ſide as <hi>concave,</hi> or what account can there be of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of both ſides ſo needleſly, but that it may be ſaid to be writ <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> as a <hi>Symbol</hi> of a <hi>twofold</hi> ſenſe belonging to theſe Prophecies, that of the <hi>Cortex</hi> or <hi>Letter,</hi> and that of the <hi>things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured.</hi> And as the <hi>Cortical</hi> or <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe is <hi>first</hi> and moſt <hi>obvious,</hi> ſo according to our <hi>Mechanical</hi> frame of this Seven-ſealed Book, the <hi>Convex</hi> or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

               <p>But if <hi>John</hi>'s declaring the Book ſealed with ſeven Seals was written <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without</hi> before any of the Seals were opened, inſinuate that there was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>no</hi> ſuch <hi>Mechanical</hi> frame of this ſeven-ſealed Roll within, as we have deſcribed; then it is a plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication to any one of an ordinary ſagacity, that this is ſaid merely to intimate thoſe two ſenſes of the Viſions: the external <hi>Cortical</hi> ſenſe, which is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, as if it were a complete thing of it ſelf, and the <hi>real Prophetical</hi> ſenſe that lies hid under this Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical <hi>Cortex.</hi> Nor does it ſeem likely, that <hi>John</hi> at the opening each Seal ſaw in the <hi>Book</hi> thoſe Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mentioned at each Seal opening, but they were repreſented to him as other Viſions were, and that he ſaw them no more in the <hi>Book</hi> at the <hi>opening</hi> of the <hi>Seals,</hi> than he <hi>read</hi> the <hi>Opened Book,</hi> when it was given him, before he ate it; but the <hi>opening</hi> of the <hi>Seals</hi> by the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and the <hi>Angel</hi> giving him the <hi>Book unſealed</hi> to <hi>eat,</hi> are only to ſignifie that both thoſe Prophecies of the <hi>Sealed Book</hi> and <hi>Opened Book</hi> are the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt to his Servant <hi>John,</hi> as you heard in the foregoing Chapter. But if it may be thought, that when <hi>John</hi> received the <hi>Opened Book,</hi> he might then obſerve that there were things written on the <hi>convex</hi> ſides and <hi>concave</hi> ſides of what I called the <hi>Viſion-leaves,</hi> and from hence pronounce in the beginning that this <hi>Seven-ſealed</hi> Book was writ <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without</hi> according to ſome ſuch <hi>Mechanick</hi> way as I have deſcribed, then our
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:34043:124"/>former reaſoning will take place, and ſo every way we may be aſſured that this is the right meaning of the Book (in the hand of him that ſate on the Throne) its being ſaid to be writ <hi>within</hi> and <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> that thereby is intimated an <hi>external Literal</hi> ſenſe and <hi>internal Myſtical</hi> ſenſe, of which the other is but an <hi>Hieroglyphick,</hi> Type or Figure.</p>
               <p>And this being ſo plain and aſſured in this Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyptick Seven-ſealed Book or Roll, that to be writ <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without</hi> ſignifies an <hi>external</hi> or <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, and a ſenſe <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>myſtical.</hi> And we finding in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> a Roll ſo deſcribed <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.9. And when I looked, behold, an hand was ſent unto me, and lo, a Roll of a Book therein. And he ſpread it before me, and it was written within and without; which anſwers with ſtrange exactneſs to this of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe,</hi> and ſtill more full, if you read the following Chapter: where he is bid to eat this Roll, and does ſo accordingly, and declares it was in his mouth as ſweet as Honey; As if what we find <hi>Apoc. Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. were tranſcribed out of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> And as this happened to <hi>John</hi> after the ſight of the Angel with a Rainbow, <hi>viz. Chriſt</hi> or the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo this happened to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> immediately after he had ſeen the appearance of the glory of the Lord, which was as the appearance of the <hi>Bow</hi> which is in the Cloud in the <hi>Day of Rain,</hi> which is a further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that it is the <hi>God of Iſrael</hi> that is ſignified by this Note of the Rainbow in both places.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, I ſay, this being ſo plain, that to be writ <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without</hi> bears ſuch a ſenſe in this place of the <hi>Apocalypſe, viz.</hi> an <hi>exteriour</hi> and <hi>interiour</hi> meaning of the Viſions or Prophecies, and this of the Roll in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> being ſo exactly parallel thereto, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:34043:124"/>ſet at the beginning of his Prophecies after the <hi>Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory</hi> Viſion, how can we avoid concluding that the Prophecies of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the main of them are parts of the Roll written <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> and have an <hi>interiour</hi> ſenſe as well as an <hi>exteriour?</hi> And ſo thoſe Viſions or Prophecies that in their firſt or <hi>exteriour</hi> ſenſe may ſeem only to concern <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſuppoſe, and <hi>Samaria, Edom</hi> and Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Army of <hi>Gog,</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh City</hi> and Temple, and the like, may in their <hi>interiour</hi> ſenſe concern the ſtate of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> or of its <hi>Enemies,</hi> and prove <hi>Types</hi> of their condition. Which Conſideration will juſtifie againſt the idle Cavils of the Unskilful what we have writ in <hi>Synopſis Prophetica,</hi> Book 2. Chap. 16. touching the Viſions of the King of <hi>Tyre</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> applying them to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now in the next place we may alſo note, That as in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> his <hi>eating</hi> of the <hi>Roll</hi> does not ſignifie that he was thereby to <hi>expound</hi> Prophecies, but to <hi>utter</hi> Prophecies himſelf: ſo in like manner S. <hi>John</hi>'s taking the <hi>Opened Book</hi> from the hand of the Angel, and eating it, and his being bid thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to propheſie, does not ſignifie <hi>expounding</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, but the <hi>uttering</hi> Prophecies himſelf, as he begins to do immediately in the next Chapter; ſo that a man may juſtly wonder that any thing ſhould blind any one ſo, as to interpret <hi>John</hi>'s being bid to propheſie, after his eating the Book, of either <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> or <hi>expounding</hi> Prophecies.</p>
               <p>And thirdly and laſtly, As <hi>Ezekiel</hi> his ſight of the Appearance of the <hi>Glory of the Lord,</hi> as of the <hi>Bow in the Cloud</hi> in the <hi>Day of Rain,</hi> was an <hi>Introductory Viſion</hi> to his eating of the Roll and propheſying;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:34043:125"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> alſo ſeeing this <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> this great Angel of the Covenant, Chriſt, with the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> on his Head, from whoſe hand he takes the <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Book,</hi> eats it and propheſies: what can this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie more naturally than that this Appearance of this glorious Angel is an <hi>Introductory Viſion</hi> to <hi>S. John</hi>'s <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy, as the Appearance of the Glory of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as was concluded before in the foregoing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter?</p>

               <p>THAT excellent uſefulneſs of having an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red knowledge that the <hi>bleſſed Reformation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by <hi>Luther,</hi> and here in <hi>England</hi> more <hi>eſpecially, perfected,</hi> was the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> which moſt naturally muſt beget a peaceful mind in men, and due value for our Church, makes me reſume again the ſeven Arguments at the end of the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>S. E.</hi> his <hi>Remarks</hi> on my <hi>Apologie,</hi> enlarging at leaſt upon <hi>ſome</hi> of them more fully, that ſo uſeful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a Matter may not be omitted or maimedly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:34043:126"/>managed in theſe <hi>Paralipomena.</hi> That the aboveſaid <hi>Reformation</hi> therefore is the <hi>Riſing of the Witneſſes,</hi> I demonſtrate thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We are to obſerve in the two firſt Viſions of the <hi>Opened Book</hi> Prophecy, <hi>viz.</hi> the Viſions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, the <hi>firſt</hi> of them in the <hi>eleventh</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypſe;</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> in the <hi>twelfth, thirteenth</hi> and <hi>fourteenth</hi> Chapters, that they begin from the ſame <hi>Epocha,</hi> and that they end in the ſame times, namely with the laſt Vial, which contains a full and final overthrow of <hi>Babylon</hi> or of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet.</hi> Whence theſe two Viſions muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Synchronal. Now that they begin from the ſame <hi>Epocha</hi> we prove thus: They both begin from the beginning of the Church. For the Viſion in the <hi>eleventh</hi> Chapter being the <hi>firſt</hi> Viſion S. <hi>John</hi> ſets down after his eating the <hi>Opened Book,</hi> and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bid to propheſie, that is to ſay, to prefigure or predict things to come, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did after his eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Roll, and what is ſet down <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. being plainly a Prophecy, it is plain this is the firſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> of the <hi>Opened Book,</hi> and therefore according to indiſpenſable Method, if any Viſions of the <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy begin from the beginning of the Church, this <hi>firſt</hi> muſt, and not be <hi>Viſio</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>decollated</hi> Viſion with its head ſtruck off. But that the Viſion of the Fight of <hi>Michael</hi> with the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and of the Woman in the pangs of Childbirth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence with the beginning of the Church (which are parts of the entire Viſion of the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth Chapters) is ſo plain a thing, that impudence it ſelf, if not ſtark blind, cannot deny it. Wherefore the Viſion of the <hi>eleventh</hi> Chapter muſt begin from the beginning of the Church as well as
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:34043:126"/>the <hi>other,</hi> and ſo muſt have the ſame <hi>Epocha.</hi> And as the <hi>fore part</hi> of the Viſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>viz.</hi> the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple meaſured and the Worſhippers therein, denote the <hi>Purity</hi> of the Primitive Times as to <hi>Worſhip:</hi> ſo the <hi>fore-part</hi> of the other Viſion, the part contained in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>viz.</hi> the Combate of <hi>Michael</hi> with the <hi>Dragon</hi> and the pangs of the childbearing Woman, denote their <hi>fortitude</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> in ſuffering for the <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that theſe two Viſions end in the ſame times is plain from hence, in that the end of the firſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.19. is a lively deſcription of the <hi>ſeventh Vial.</hi> There were Lightnings and Voices, and Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and an Earthquake and great Hail, the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription that is found <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 18, 21. and no where elſe are thoſe five <hi>Phaenomena</hi> put in the whole <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe:</hi> So that the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe two Viſions ends in the <hi>ſeventh. Vial.</hi> That the <hi>ſecond</hi> does ſo too is plain, for that it ends with the treading of the Wine-preſs, where blood came out even to the Horſe-bridles. Which therefore muſt be the ſlaughter by that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Heros</hi> on the <hi>white Horſe, Apoc.</hi> 19. Commander of the Army in the Battel of that great day of God Almighty, which is plainly under the <hi>ſeventh Vial.</hi> Wherefore <hi>theſe two</hi> Viſions beginning from <hi>one Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> and ending with the <hi>ſeventh Vial,</hi> do Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the <hi>fore-part</hi> of theſe two Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Viſions repreſent a <hi>pure</hi> Church <hi>conflicting</hi> with the <hi>Pagans,</hi> over whom at laſt they get the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. ſo in the next or <hi>middle parts</hi> of theſe two Viſions, the <hi>former</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 2. to <hi>v.</hi> 11. in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. the <hi>latter</hi> the <hi>whole thirteenth</hi> Chapter, there is contained the <hi>like Conflict</hi> betwixt
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34043:127"/>the <hi>pure Apoſtolick</hi> Church, and the <hi>Apoſtatized</hi> Church or <hi>Pagano-Chriſtians,</hi> and a <hi>Victory</hi> noted <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13. in the <hi>former</hi> and in the <hi>latter Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 8. the foregoing verſes being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrable to this Conflict as the deſcription of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Lamb. So that the <hi>middle-parts</hi> of the two Viſions exquiſitely anſwer one another, theſe <hi>middle-parts</hi> of both the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> Viſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a <hi>War</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> or Souldiers of the Lamb or <hi>Saints</hi> with the <hi>Beaſt:</hi> and we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the event of that War is an <hi>actual</hi> but <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> overthrow of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> or <hi>Babylon</hi> called the great City, as is manifeſt from <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13. unto which anſwers the actual Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Viſion. Which muſt needs be <hi>Actual,</hi> elſe the Angel would ſpeak an untruth in ſaying, <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon is fallen, is fallen,</hi> Chap. 14. v. 8. and but <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi> becauſe it both anſwers to that in the <hi>firſt</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and precedes the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Vial in the <hi>ſecond,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which the full and final overthrow of <hi>Babylon</hi> is not. And whereas <hi>Prophecy</hi> is <hi>anticipatory</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and yet no <hi>actual</hi> ſucceſs of the forty two months War, but this Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> is prefigured in this <hi>ſecond</hi> Viſion, it is plain that this is the ſucceſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and immediately before menaced by the firſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, declaring the Judgments of God againſt the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous <hi>Beſtians,</hi> and therefore the very ſame with the <hi>partial</hi> Fall of the great City and the Riſing of the Witneſſes in the <hi>firſt</hi> Viſion: which was in the laſt Half-Day of the three days and an half, or in the laſt Half-Time of the three times and an half. Whence the Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> the Angel brings news of, muſt be ſo too, and not before, becauſe the upſhot of that War alſo was not till then. We ſee therefore what a
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34043:127"/>perfect Correſpondency the <hi>middle parts</hi> of the <hi>two</hi> Viſions (which parts are terminated in the ſucceſs of the Beaſt's War with the Saints or Witneſſes) have one with another.</p>
               <p>Thirdly therefore, Foraſmuch as the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Viſion is the ſame with the <hi>Fall</hi> of the <hi>great City</hi> and <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in the <hi>firſt,</hi> and this latter, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Fall</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> and the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> is juſt at the cloſe of the <hi>ſixth</hi> Trumpet, the former muſt be ſo too, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt be at the <hi>cloſe</hi> of the <hi>ſixth</hi> Trumpet alſo, and the <hi>third</hi> or remaining part of each Viſion muſt be after the <hi>ſixth</hi> Trumpet for the ſame reaſon.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Foraſmuch as this <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> is an ample object of Joy and Thankſgiving to the <hi>Evangelici</hi> the Witneſſes and ſealed Souldiers of the Lamb againſt whom the Beaſt warred, and was too hard for them all along, though they held out through Patience and Faith and Hope of promiſed ſucceſs at laſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. (theſe being <hi>encouraged</hi> as well as the Beſtians <hi>menaced</hi> by the firſt Angel) therefore as there is a joyful Meſſage by the ſecond Angel of the <hi>actual</hi> Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> in the ſecond Viſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 8. ſo it is impoſſible but thoſe Acclamations in Heaven and Doxology of the Elders, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17. ſhould reſpect the <hi>partial</hi> but <hi>actual</hi> Fall of the City and <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> it being ſo ample an Object of thoſe joyful Acclamations and of that thankful Doxology, and there being nothing betwixt but the graceful uſhering them in with the ſound of the ſeventh Trumpet. For though they may glance at more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged hopes of <hi>future</hi> Acceſſions, yet the principal
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34043:128"/>Object and <hi>Occaſion</hi> of this Thankſgiving is the actual <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> For were it not ſo, this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Providence and illuſtrious Victory would be without any Doxology or Thankſgiving, which is groſly abſurd, that there ſhould be no ſhout nor ſign of Joy at ſuch a ſurprizing Providence as this, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the reviving of the two Witneſſes, when they had lyen ſlain three days and an half in the ſtreets of the City: nor at their aſcending in a Cloud into Heaven in the view of all the people, the tenth part of their City who ſlew them, falling in the mean time by an Earthquake, and many thouſands of their Enemies buried in the Ruines. How incredible, how unſuitable a thing is it, that ſo happy a <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of the Witneſſes ſufferings as this ſhould paſs without a <hi>Plaudite?</hi> Therefore it is a ſenſleſs thing not to make the Riſing of the Witneſſes and the Fall of the City the Object of thoſe Acclamations and of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xology of the Elders, and contrary to the uſual Mode of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> that ever cloſeth the good ſucceſs of the Church with ſome indications of Joy and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: as <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 10 12. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 1. and again <hi>v.</hi> 21. which concludes with a Feaſt of Joy and Thankſgiving for the Victory of the Rider of the white Horſe. Wherefore it is abundantly plain, that thoſe Acclamations and the Elders Doxology reſpect this event of the Riſing of the Witneſſes; And is yet further manifeſt from that paſſage in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xology it ſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 27. where thanks is given to God Almighty, becauſe he <hi>has</hi> taken to him his great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and hath reigned, <hi>viz.</hi> in that Fall of the great City and Riſing of the Witneſſes, in this he reſumed a conſiderable part of his Kingdom which Antichriſt had uſurped. But if it reſpect not this, the very
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:34043:128"/>Aſſertion is falſe, and Thanks is given for nothing.</p>
               <p>Fifthly therefore, We being ſo well aſſured that the <hi>partial</hi> Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and Riſing of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is the <hi>Object</hi> of the joyful Annunciation of the ſecond Angel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. and of the Doxology of the Elders, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. and meeting in the very next Viſion to theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Vials</hi> with a Song (prefixt thereto) of Praiſe and Thankſgiving by the <hi>Victos</hi> over the <hi>Beaſt</hi> for an <hi>actual</hi> but <hi>partial</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, ſuch as that was over him in the two forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Viſions (and this in this Song diſcovers it ſelf to be <hi>actual,</hi> becauſe it is ſaid therein, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>For thy judgments are made manifeſt, viz.</hi> in that late Fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and yet the Victory implied in this Song is but <hi>partial,</hi> becauſe the Song is prefixt <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Vials</hi> which are to bring to paſs the full and final ruine thereof) and there being <hi>no</hi> prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>partial</hi> Victory but this in the <hi>Fall</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> which may be the <hi>Object</hi> of this Song of Thankſgiving, like that of <hi>Moſes</hi> upon the Overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> it is impoſſible but this Song muſt be to the ſame effect with the Doxology of the Elders, and ſynchronize with it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly therefore, It is as clear as Noon-day, that that Doxology of the Elders immediately following the ſixth Trumpet, this Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> muſt immediately follow the ſixth Trumpet.</p>
               <p>And now Seventhly and laſtly, <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Vials</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that they all <hi>follow</hi> the <hi>ſixth</hi> Trumpet and the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and conſequently there being no part of the two firſt Viſions of the <hi>Opened Book</hi> (which begin from one <hi>Epocha,</hi> and end with
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:34043:129"/>the ſeventh Vial) which prefigures that notable and indeed ſtupendious Atchievement of Providence (which therefore cannot but be predicted within this ſpace) in cauſing ſo many Provinces, Principalities, Nations and Kingdoms to caſt off the Pope in the late Reformation begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> unleſs this of the partial Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> (For all the Vials are after their Riſing: And if any one will be ſo freakiſh, as notwithſtanding to pitch upon ſome one of the Vials to be a Prediction of the late Reformation, I demand what Event before the Reformation is the fulfilling of that illuſtrious Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Riſing of the Witneſſes, for the Event that anſwers to it muſt be ſo notorious, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be paſſed by in Hiſtory) It neceſſarily there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follows, that the aforeſaid Reformation <hi>only,</hi> can be the Event that anſwers to the Viſion of the <hi>partial</hi> Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and conſequently be that which the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> gives thanks for.

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. <hi>Whether the Witneſſes wear ſackcloth for any time after their being riſen. Whether the</hi> Vial-Angels <hi>received their Vials before or after the Song of</hi> Moſes <hi>and the</hi> Lamb <hi>ſung by the</hi> Victors <hi>over the</hi> Beaſt. <hi>What is the adequate</hi> Viſum <hi>of the</hi> ſixth <hi>Trumpet. What the</hi> full <hi>meaning of the Lamb's being found worthy to</hi> open the Seals <hi>of the</hi> Seven-ſealed <hi>Book. Whether a year in the</hi> Apocalypſe <hi>any where ſignifies a</hi> Year of years. <hi>Whether there be any</hi> myſtical <hi>meaning in noting Prophetick Time ſometimes by</hi> Days, <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by</hi> Months.</head>
               <p>IT is demonſtrated in the foregoing Chapter with Evidence plainly Mathematical, that the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> begun by <hi>Luther</hi> is the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> but there being ſome ingenious and diligent Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> who, though they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the aboveſaid <hi>Reformation</hi> is the fulfilling of the Viſion of the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> yet think their wearing of ſackcloth may be extended to a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time; I ſhall endeavour here to clear that Point. And in order thereto we are firſt to conſider, that the wearing of ſackcloth is not <hi>literally</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, but is only a <hi>Symbol</hi> of a <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>ſqualid</hi> condition, and of a <hi>grieved</hi> and <hi>penſive</hi> heart, which are things <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with the Witneſſes being <hi>riſen</hi> from the <hi>death</hi> they were in, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Political</hi> Death, whoſe Reſurrection implies the contrary, proſperity and reſpect according to their different degrees of Quality. Wherefore the nature of the thing it ſelf
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:34043:130"/>may teach us that the <hi>riſen</hi> Witneſſes, in their <hi>being riſen,</hi> did <hi>ipſo facto</hi> put off their ſackcloth, and were clad with garments of Joy. Beſides, the Text does aſſure us thereof, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17. For what were thoſe Acclamations in Heaven there, and the four and twenty Elders Doxology, but an intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what a time of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Triumph</hi> it would be on Earth upon the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> and could they themſelves then be in ſuch a ſqualid and forlorn condition as to wear ſackcloth? Again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> is ſaid to be ſung by them that had got the Victory over the Beaſt and over his Image, and over his Mark and over the Number of his Name. Which <hi>Victors</hi> over the Beaſt moſt aſſuredly are the very <hi>Witneſſes</hi> againſt whom he warred, this Song being Synchronal to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations in Heaven and Doxology of the Elders. What then ſhall we think that theſe <hi>Triumphant Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> while they had the Harps of God in their hands, and <hi>ſung</hi> this joyful <hi>Epinikion</hi> to them, wore <hi>ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth</hi> on their backs, what can be more incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?</p>
               <p>But I will yet add a third place, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. there is mention of the 144000 ſealed ones which ſynchronize, and indeed are the ſame with the 144000, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. which are the <hi>Souldiers</hi> of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and who are warred againſt by the Beaſt during the time of the firſt ſix Trumpets. For though in the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy this <hi>Sealing</hi> ſeems to be done at once imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the firſt Trumpet ſounds, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it is a continued thing all along the time of the firſt ſix Trumpets, which is for about twelve hundred years, for ſuch a ſpace the ſealed Souldiers
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:34043:130"/>of the Lamb, as conflicting with the Beaſt, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to continue, but at the end of the ſixth Trumpet the Victory is obtained, <hi>Babylon falls, viz.</hi> the tenth part thereof, and the <hi>Witneſſes riſe,</hi> and as I noted before, ſing the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Lamb;</hi> and as <hi>that</hi> is the ſign of their Victory <hi>there,</hi> ſo their being <hi>cloathed</hi> in <hi>white Robes,</hi> and having <hi>Palms</hi> in their hands, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.9. denotes the ſame here. And <hi>v.</hi> 14. in that they are ſaid to be thoſe that came out of great Tribulation, it implies their freſh emergency out of the calamities they ſuffered under the entire Reign and Tyranny of the Beaſt. After which Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of the Saints or Witneſſes, you ſee they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with appear <hi>cloathed</hi> in <hi>white Robes,</hi> which is a plain Argument they had put off their ſackcloth, which is the thing I aimed at.</p>
               <p>Nor can the Argument be eluded by pretending, that theſe here cloathed in <hi>white Robes</hi> with <hi>Palms</hi> in their hands, are thoſe mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. to whom <hi>white Robes</hi> are given, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Primitive Martyrs</hi> who obtain a bleſſed Reſurrection at this time for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the <hi>Dragon,</hi> as thoſe do at the beginning of the <hi>Millennium</hi> for ſuffering under the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the deſcription alſo of their condition implying it to be their aſſumption into Heaven, not a ſtate on Earth: For to this I anſwer, beſides the abſurdity of making more Reſurrections than two, the correſpondency of the 144000 ſealed ones to the 144000 with the <hi>Lamb</hi> on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> ſhows plainly that inſtating of theſe <hi>Palm-bearing Victors</hi> in their white Robes, into that <hi>State</hi> here deſcribed, is not till after the ſixth Trumpet at the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> There begins the joyful condition of the <hi>Palm-bearers,</hi> and reaches to the end of all including the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:34043:131"/>and bleſſed <hi>Millennium.</hi> Which <hi>New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>-ſtate being ſo deſcribed as to be alſo a fit <hi>Type</hi> of the Church <hi>Triumphant</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous that this Viſion alſo may be ſo framed as to be <hi>Typical</hi> of that ſtate likewiſe, though in the mean time it is a Prophecy of the ſtate of the Church on <hi>Earth.</hi> But that thoſe in white Robes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 11. anſwers ſo handſomly to the <hi>Palm-bearing</hi> Victors in <hi>white Robes, Chap.</hi> 7.9. this is but a pleaſant <hi>Lemma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſynechia</hi> in the <hi>Cortex</hi> which occurs oft, and which entraps many heedleſs Readers of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be aware. Wherefore I think it is a plain caſe, that theſe <hi>Palm-bearing Victors</hi> in white Robes are the ſame with the <hi>Victors</hi> over the <hi>Beaſt, Chap.</hi> 15. and they with the <hi>Riſen Witneſſes, Chap.</hi> 11. who being upon their Victory and freſh emergency out of great tribulation <hi>cloathed</hi> in <hi>white Robes,</hi> did not continue any time after their Conqueſt cloathed in <hi>Sackcloth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Something akin to this protracting the time of the Witneſſes wearing ſackcloth beyond their Riſing, is that opinion of ſome, who, although they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Reformation</hi> to be the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> yet will not have the fulfilling of the Viſion of their Riſing <hi>completed</hi> therein, but expect a <hi>further</hi> Riſing of them ſignified, as they would have it, by this very Viſion. But the miſtake of this Opinion I ſhall manifeſtly diſcover in the following Chapter.</p>
               <p>The next thing I will conſider here is this: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Vial-Angels</hi> received their Vials <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Lamb, Chap.</hi> 15. That they received them <hi>after,</hi> any one may be well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that obſerves, Firſt, That <hi>one</hi> continued Viſion is divided ſometimes into <hi>ſeveral</hi> Chapters: As the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:34043:131"/>Viſion to the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Prophecy, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4, and 5. as alſo that <hi>one</hi> Viſion comprized in the 12.13. and 14. Chapters. Which anſwers to that contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the eleventh. Secondly, That in like manner the Viſion of the <hi>Vial-Angels</hi> is contained in the 15. and 16. Chapters. Thirdly, That to ſo large a Viſion the firſt verſe of <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. [And I ſaw another ſign in Heaven great and wonderful, ſeven Angels having the ſeven laſt Plagues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] is but the <hi>general Title</hi> thereof, and the <hi>Vials</hi> are not ſo much as mentioned in this Title. Fourthly; That before he falls upon the Viſion it ſelf, there is an <hi>Introduction</hi> thereto, a kind of <hi>Dramatical</hi> Interlude, which is not as in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Plays, merely for delight, but for ſome weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inſtruction, elſe there can be no ſenſe of clapping it immediately after the ſummary Title of this Viſion. What then can it be but to intimate, that the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Vials</hi> is to be <hi>after</hi> this Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Lamb.</hi> Wherefore it being ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 5. After that (that is after the ſinging of this Song) I looked, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> After this the ſeven <hi>Vial-Angels</hi> came out of the Temple, having the ſeven Plagues, but <hi>not</hi> yet ſaid to have the <hi>Vials,</hi> but immediately to receive them of one of the four Beaſts, and in the beginning of the next Chapter bid to pour them on the Earth. If the ſenſe of this expreſs order of things be not, that the Angels received their Vials after the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> we cannot be aſſured of the certain ſenſe of any paſſage of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> nor of the whole Bible, no nor of any Writing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Inſomuch that I have been amazed that it ever came into any mans mind to think otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>A third thing is, What the adequate <hi>Viſum</hi> is of the ſixth Trumpet, <hi>i. e.</hi> what affairs in the World or
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:34043:132"/>Church are noted to fall out during the ſounding of that Trumpet. To which I anſwer, That it is that which is ſet down <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. from <hi>v.</hi> 13. to the end of the Chapter. Whereby is ſignified the <hi>Over-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire and the Church by the <hi>Turks</hi> with the poſſeſſing themſelves of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and the <hi>general Impenitency</hi> of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church and Empire, notwithſtanding this notorious Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon the <hi>Eaſtern.</hi> Which latter part is fully expreſt <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21. And the reſt of the men that were not killed with theſe Plagues, yet repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not of the works of their hands, that they ſhould not worſhip Daemons and Idols of Gold and Silver and Braſs and Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither repented they of their Murders, nor of their Sorceries, nor of their Fornication, nor of their Thefts. That this is the adequate object of the Viſion of the ſixth Trumpet I conceive is plain from hence. Firſt, That immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after this, inſtead of the Angel of the ſixth Trumpet that ſounded, ſteps in a mighty Angel to roar out the next Interval the laſt of the ſeven, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided alſo into <hi>ſeven Thunders,</hi> as the <hi>ſeventh Seal</hi> into <hi>ſeven Trumpets.</hi> Secondly, Becauſe if this be not the preciſe <hi>Viſum</hi> or <hi>Object</hi> of the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the ſixth Trumpet, there will be no ſtop till you come to the 14. verſe of <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>The ſecond we is paſt,</hi> &amp;c. Which is the moſt outragious wild thing to be conceived as can be, the Viſion of the Witneſſes in ſackcloth running up as high as the firſt Trumpet, to ſay nothing of the meaſuring the Court of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Altar. And thirdly and laſtly, which nicks the buſineſs, methinks, marvellouſly well, The Riſing of the Witneſſes and Fall of the City is a Prophecy of a conſiderable Reformation, that is, of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:34043:132"/>of a conſiderable part of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church and Empire, or of their <hi>ceaſing</hi> to be <hi>impenitent,</hi> which was the latter part of the <hi>Viſum</hi> of the ſixth Trumpet. Wherefore immediately upon this Riſing of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Fall of the City, that is, upon the <hi>ceaſing of that general Impenitency,</hi> it being ſaid the <hi>ſecond Wo</hi> is paſt, it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Turks over-running</hi> the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire and the <hi>general Impenitency</hi> of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> thereupon was the <hi>adequate Viſum</hi> of the ſixth Trumpet. And theſe three Points reſpect the foregoing Chapter. There are three Points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind that have no ſuch reference.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, what may be the <hi>full</hi> meaning of the Lamb's being found worthy to <hi>open the Seals</hi> of the <hi>Seven-ſealed</hi> Book. For the fulneſs of this meaning being rightly underſtood, we ſhall therewithal better diſcern how well the <hi>Doxologies</hi> of the four Beaſts and twenty four Elders, and after of thoſe numerous Quires of Angels, and indeed of the whole Creation in this <hi>Dramatical</hi> Theatre in <hi>Heaven,</hi> are made to <hi>prefigure</hi> the <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Rejoycing</hi> which will be in the bleſſed <hi>Millennium</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> when the <hi>Power</hi> given to the Lamb of <hi>opening the Seals</hi> ſhall have that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effect in introducing thoſe times of the <hi>New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> which theſe <hi>Angelical Actors</hi> on an <hi>Heavenly Stage</hi> are made to <hi>prefigure</hi> in the ſight and hearing of S. <hi>John</hi> after his being caught up into Heaven in his Divine Rapture mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in brief I conceive that the Lamb's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Book, and therewith a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>opening the Seals,</hi> implies theſe <hi>two</hi> things. The <hi>first</hi> is the repreſenting to <hi>John,</hi> by way of Prophetical Viſion, the ſtate of the Church and of the World, ſo far forth as the Church is concerned in the affairs thereof
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:34043:133"/>through a long Series of time to the end of all, even to the very <hi>Conflagration.</hi> That this is one meaning of this <hi>power</hi> of <hi>opening the Seals</hi> is plain from <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.1. in which ſeven places the Lamb is ſaid orderly to open the Seals one after another, and upon the opening each Seal a Prophetick Viſion follows. Whence it is manifeſt, that his Power of <hi>opening</hi> the <hi>ſeven Seals,</hi> is the Power of imparting this whole Book of Viſions to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>John.</hi> For at the Opening of the ſeventh Seal all the whole Book of the Prophetick Viſions was opened, as is to be underſtood from the frame of the Book above deſcribed.</p>
               <p>But now foraſmuch as the <hi>truly</hi> opening of the Seals would not be abſolutely put into the hand of Chriſt, unleſs he had alſo Power given from him that ſits on the Throne to guide the affairs of this ſublunary World, ſo as that he might bring to paſs by permiſſion or impulſion and poſitive motion the things that are <hi>prefigured</hi> (For the Effect brought to paſs both argues the <hi>truth</hi> and diſcovers the <hi>right ſenſe</hi> of the Prophetick Viſion at once) this Power of adminiſtring all things, and ordering them ſo, that they ſhall certainly anſwer to the Prophetick Prefigurations of them, is neceſſarily the <hi>other</hi> thing that is included in this <hi>power</hi> of <hi>opening the Seals</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Lamb. And hence <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are aſcribed to him as well as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Might, Power,</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> as well as <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in thoſe <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xologies</hi> of the four Beaſts and twenty four Elders, of the numerous Quires of Angels, and of the whole Creation glancing in this <hi>Prophetical Rapture</hi> at thoſe times wherein the effect of this <hi>power</hi> of <hi>opening the Seals</hi> will appear to all the world moſt <hi>reſplendent</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:34043:133"/>and <hi>glorious.</hi> So that thoſe <hi>Arehetypal Millennial</hi> Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> the twenty four Elders are made to ſing the Song of thoſe <hi>Ectypal</hi> Kings in the <hi>Millennium,</hi> who will <hi>experimentally</hi> find what is <hi>prophetically</hi> ſet down here in the Song of the twenty four <hi>crowned</hi> Elders, <hi>Thou art worthy to receive the Book, and open the Seals thereof,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and haſt made us Kings and Prieſts to our God, and we ſhall reign upon Earth,</hi> viz. in this bleſſed <hi>Millennium</hi> which thou haſt as well <hi>effected</hi> as <hi>predicted</hi> through that <hi>Power</hi> given thee of thy Father.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Point is, Whether a <hi>Year</hi> in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe</hi> any where may ſignifie a <hi>Year of years?</hi> The meaning of which Queſtion is, Whether that expreſs word <hi>[Year]</hi> whether it be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> (for that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which ſignifies Time, and in the literal meaning a Year, denotes a year of years in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where a <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>half a Time</hi> do oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, is without queſtion) whether theſe, I ſay, any where ſignifie a Year of years, or in correſpondence to other places of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> are to ſignifie ſo? That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is rendred a Year, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Year of years, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 9.15. where the four Angels on the great River <hi>Euphrates</hi> are ſaid to be prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year, ſeems very probable. Becauſe interpreting a day, month and year; [a year, a month of years, and a year of years] it makes up three hundred nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix years, which is exactly the time from <hi>Togrul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec</hi> Prince of the Turks his Inauguration by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liph Chaiim Biamrilla</hi> (after the taking of <hi>Bagdad</hi>) to the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Which is not probable to be a fortuitous hit, and therefore plain that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> [a year] in this place

                  </gap> ſignifying a year of years, but an aſſurance rather of the contrary, that it ſignifies a common year conſiſting of three hundred ſixty five days. Otherwiſe if this <gap reason="foreign">

How ſtrong the Arguments are, you will quickly recollect by merely reminding you of them. (1.) The three Times and an half equal to forty two Months plainly anſwer to three Days and an half. Three <hi>Integrals</hi> and an <hi>half</hi> to the three <hi>Integrals</hi> and an <hi>half.</hi> (2.) That there is no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> a Number ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the curioſity of <hi>half a year.</hi> (3.) That if the Evangelical Church ſhould ever be reduced to ſuch a condition as is ſet out by the Witneſſes lying ſlain in the ſtreets, it is incredible they ſhould get up again within three years and an half. (4.) If the three years and an half be reſtrained to the end of their propheſying, nothing in the Viſion is a <hi>Symbol</hi> of their <hi>Political Death</hi> to which their <hi>Reſurrection</hi> relates. (5.) They having been politically dead all along the forty two months, and often perſecuted,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:34043:136"/>martyred and maſſacred, it is unimaginable what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more direful condition ſhould befal them ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by their lying ſlain three days and an half, than what befel them before; ſo that it muſt be a Symbol really of their three times and an half ſufferings. (6.) And laſtly, If the Beaſt war not with them till they have finiſhed their Teſtimony, as thoſe that oppoſe us would have it, then till the end of their propheſying, there is neither any war nor overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor killing of the Witneſſes, which is point-blank againſt the Truth of Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 5. The <hi>Affirmative</hi> of the fifth <hi>Query</hi> is plain and expreſs from the Text it ſelf, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 14. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.8. which intimates the iſſue of the War of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with the <hi>Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 6. That the <hi>Affirmative</hi> of this <hi>Query</hi> is true may likewiſe appear from the Text it ſelf, namely, that it is the <hi>final</hi> iſſue of the War. For this Iſſue is ſaid to be after the three days and an half, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.11. which as I doubt not but that it is the ſame with <hi>Daniel</hi>'s three times and an half, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with the forty two months and twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty days; ſo though we ſhould yield they ſignifie but three years and an half, and thus theſe three days and an half were either the three laſt years of the twelve hundred and ſixty, or three years and an half added to them, yet it does invincibly follow from this Text, that the iſſue of the <hi>once</hi> proſperous <hi>War</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> againſt the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Witneſſes</hi> is a <hi>final Iſſue,</hi> it being juſt at the end of the time of that War.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 7. The <hi>Negative</hi> of this <hi>Query</hi> is plain at firſt ſight. No man can conceive a War produced fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the <hi>final</hi> iſſue thereof. This conſideration
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:34043:136"/>and what has been ſaid on the foregoing <hi>Query,</hi> puts all out of doubt. Let us only here note by the bye, that there is no forty two months Reign of the Beaſt diſtinct from his proſperous warring againſt the Saints and Witneſſes. His <hi>proſperous</hi> War or <hi>proſperous</hi> reigning and retaining the <hi>entireneſs</hi> of his Dominions is <hi>reſtrained</hi> to this time of forty two months, but his <hi>reigning at large</hi> is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 8. The <hi>Affirmative</hi> of this <hi>eighth</hi> Query is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from the <hi>Affirmative</hi> of the <hi>ſixth,</hi> where it is made plain, in what is ſaid thereon, that the <hi>partial Fall</hi> of the great City, and the <hi>then Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> is the <hi>final</hi> iſſue of the War of the Beaſt againſt the Saints and Witneſſes. And that the Riſing of the Witneſſes is the aboveſaid Reformation, is the <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> Query.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 9. The <hi>Affirmative</hi> of this laſt <hi>Query</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably true. And therefore we may here adore the Wiſdom of God, or his Spirit of Prophecy, who (foreſeeing how the Events would be in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of this Viſion of the Riſing of the Witneſſes in the above-mentioned Reformation, which was to fall out as it did ſo early in the laſt Semi-time, and was completed ſo long before the expiring thereof) gives us ſuch a ſeaſonable hint in the Concluſion of the Viſion of the two Witneſſes (by adumbrating the time of their Sufferings under the Beaſt by three days and an half, which ſo obviouſly reminds us of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s three Times and an half) as thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us and warrant us to compute the Event of the Medial Viſions by Semi-times. And after the laſt <hi>Semi-time current,</hi> which anſwers to the <hi>Half-Day,</hi> did fall out according to Prediction the partial Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and the Riſing of the Witneſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:34043:137"/>late bleſſed <hi>Reformation,</hi> and ceaſed to get further ground or enlargement before the <hi>Semi-time</hi> expired. Which is a Demonſtration that this Viſion of the Riſing of the Witneſſes can be continued no further. But whatever Acceſſions for the future are made to the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by his Victories over <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> they muſt be prefigured by other Viſions.

               <p>THAT the forty two months Reign of the Beaſt does not commence with the <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> but fifty or ſixty years after, theſe three Arguments are produced to prove the ſame.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the forty two months of the Beaſt cannot begin till Supremacy and Idolatry be joined in one Soveraignty or <hi>ſeventh</hi> Head, which was not till the Empire was divided into ten Kingdoms, which is fifty or ſixty years after the Apoſtaſie appeared in the Empire.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:34043:138"/>
               <p n="2">2. As the Empire was not accounted the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> till the ſupreme Head the <hi>Caeſars</hi> were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> So the Chriſtian Empire cannot be deemed the <hi>Beaſt</hi> till the ſupreme Head thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Pagano-Chriſtian,</hi> and this was not till it was actually ten-horned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Beaſt did not come into being until the <hi>ten Kings</hi> roſe in the Empire, and it became divided into ten Kingdoms, foraſmuch as the Beaſt is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with <hi>ten Crowns</hi> in the Viſion upon his Horns. Which implies the <hi>actual</hi> Diviſion of the Empire into ten Kingdoms. Which yet was not till about ſixty years after the <hi>Apoſtaſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I anſwer to theſe three Arguments I think it not amiſs to profeſs, that I agree with him that produces them in the Concluſion they are produced for, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is not rational to begin the account of the Beaſts forty two months Reign ſooner than the Empire became <hi>Idolatrous</hi> in the Supreme or <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power</hi> of it. For this Beaſt is under the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Head</hi> (though eighth King) and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Pagano-Chriſtian</hi> Head. But I cannot but here take notice of that paſſage of the Prophecy that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates this <hi>eighth King,</hi> Chap. 7. v. 11. <hi>And the Beaſt that was and is not, he is the eighth.</hi> Where he names the Beaſt <hi>it ſelf</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Head</hi> thereof: not ſurely as if he had no Head, but to intimate the <hi>difficulty</hi> to find whom to make this <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> or eighth King, whether the <hi>Secular Caeſars</hi> or that <hi>Rex Sacrorum</hi> the <hi>two-horned Beaſt,</hi> which from the beginning had in a manner all the ſway in matters of Religion, and is the ſame with the <hi>Woman on the Beaſt,</hi> which from the beginning of the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> ſhe <hi>rid</hi> and <hi>guided,</hi> and what is that but to be his <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:34043:138"/>or <hi>Head?</hi> As the man is ſaid to be the Head of the woman, becauſe he has the Rule over her, ſo in this ſenſe may the woman be ſaid to be the Head of the Beaſt. And indeed from the time of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie</hi> to the Reformation the Roman Empire ſeems to have been <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> or <hi>Hierarchical,</hi> as if the <hi>Clay,</hi> not the <hi>Iron</hi> were the Kingdom, as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſeems to intimate <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.41. where he ſays, <hi>The Kingdom</hi> ſhall be divided, but there ſhall be in it <hi>of the ſtrength of the Iron:</hi> as if indeed the <hi>Clay</hi> were the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but it ſhould be <hi>ſtrengthened</hi> with the <hi>Iron.</hi> So that by this rate the <hi>whole</hi> Paganc-chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Hierarchy (as well <hi>Eaſtern</hi> as <hi>Weſtern</hi>) or the two horned Beaſt which ſignifies the ſame, may prove the <hi>eighth</hi> King or <hi>ſeventh</hi> Head of the Beaſt.</p>
               <p>Whether this <hi>Hierarchical</hi> Pagano-Chriſtian Head, or whether the Pagano-chriſtianizing <hi>Caeſars</hi> or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, till the Pope over-top't them even in <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Power be the ſeventh Head, the Prophecy ſeems ſhy in determining, leaving every one to his own judgment. And truly I have been always very prone to think that the Pagano-chriſtianizing <hi>Caeſars</hi> or Emperours, till the Pope uſurped <hi>Jus utriuſ<expan>
                        <am>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> gladii,</hi> were the ſeventh Head of the Beaſt. For they gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Power to the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beaſt, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing or conniving at or not oppoſing his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gano-Chriſtian Inſtitutes <hi>(Qui non vetat peccare cùm poſſit jubet)</hi> they themſelves become guilty of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gano-Chriſtianiſm. Beſides, that it is no queſtion but they practiſed with the Church thoſe Idolatrous Superſtitions that refer to the <hi>Mahuzzim,</hi> &amp;c. But if any one will make the Pagano-Chriſtian Hierarchy the ſeventh Head, there is ſo much to be ſaid for it, that I will not greatly quarrel with him. And I am
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:34043:139"/>inclined to think that this is the very Myſtery of that paſſage in the Prophecy, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.11. of naming the <hi>Beast himſelf</hi> inſtead of his <hi>Head,</hi> to leave it thus <hi>in medio,</hi> whether you will have it <hi>Hierarchical</hi> or <hi>Caeſarean.</hi> And having premiſed thus much, I ſhall now briefly anſwer to the Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the firſt then I ſay, That ſo ſoon as the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> came in, which includes in it Pagano-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Superſtitions and ſome degrees at leaſt of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> there was a <hi>ſeventh</hi> Head of that very hue, whether you will deem it the <hi>Hierarchical</hi> Head who were the Introducers of this Apoſtaſie, or the <hi>Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean,</hi> who by countenancing, complying with, or not oppoſing this Apoſtaſie, became guilty of the ſame, and chargeable therewith in the Prophecy. But if you will not have the Chriſtian <hi>Caeſars</hi> after the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> chargeable with Idolatry till they make Decrees for it, and incorporate it into the Law of the Empire, as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> did the Orthodox Faith out of the Oecumenical Councils, the Reign of the Beaſt will not begin till ſix or ſeven hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt. And then the Riſing of the Witneſſes, which is the <hi>final</hi> iſſue of the forty two months War (and therefore muſt be at leaſt in the laſt month, <hi>viz.</hi> the forty ſecond) will happen in the thirty firſt or twenty ſeventh month, ſo that all will break a pieces.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the ſecond I anſwer, That the ſupreme Head of the Beaſt became Pagano-Chriſtian before the Empire was divided into ten Kingdoms, even at the beginning of the Apoſtaſie, as was anſwered to the firſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the third I ſay, The Beaſt was in being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ten Kings roſe in the Empire. For it was
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:34043:139"/>not the ten Horns that made it a Beaſt, that is, its being divided into ten Kingdoms, but its Pagano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianizing, its reintroducing old Pagan Rites and Superſtitious and Idolatrous uſages into Chriſtianity, and ſo making the Empire the Beaſt, <hi>That was, is not, and yet is.</hi> This was a doing, and in ſome ſort done at the ſounding of the firſt Trumpet, which begins with the <hi>Epocha</hi> of this <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> and brings in thoſe Commanders of the Northern Nations, whoſe very Invaſion of the Empire is the <hi>beginning</hi> of their <hi>catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> at Crowns and <hi>Principalities,</hi> though it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an hundred years till they all ten were <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> or <hi>ſped,</hi> the Church advancing ſtill more and more in her <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> as the time went on. And the Diviſion of the Empire into ten Kingdoms ſignified by the ten Horns, is a ſure Note of the beginning of the Apoſtaſie, it beginning at a time of their catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Kingdoms, which began with the ſound of the firſt Trumpet, and with the forty two months War or proſperous Reign of the Beaſt, which ended with the Riſing of the Witneſſes and laſt blaſt of the ſixth Trumpet. So exact is the Synchroniſm of the forty two months and the ſix firſt Trumpets rightly. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
               <p>Nor is the Beaſt repreſented in the Viſion with its ten Horns crowned to ſignifie the Empire was not a Beaſt till it was thus actually divided into ten King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but that it was a Beſtianizing while the ten Horns were catching at and actually obtaining one after another their reſpective Kingdoms. So that the Beaſt began to be at leaſt with the catching at and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Kingdom by the firſt of the ten Horns. But <hi>all</hi> the <hi>ten</hi> Horns are exhibited as <hi>crowned</hi> in <hi>Counter-diſtinction</hi> to the Repreſentation of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:34043:140"/>
                  <hi>Pagan,</hi> where there are ſeven Heads and ten Horns, but the Horns <hi>without Crowns,</hi> that we may be ſure the Viſion belongs to the Empire after it had become Chriſtian. And thus the forty two months of the Beaſt and the ſound of the firſt Trumpet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the time of the <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> it is evident the twelve hundred and ſixty days of the mournful Prophecy of the Witneſſes and the reſt of the ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronizing <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> commence from the ſame <hi>Epocha,</hi> and conſequently that the twelve hundred and ſixty days expired about thirty years ago.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the moſt material things in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I will anſwer very briefly. What you alledge therefore out of my ſelf, that I allow of a <hi>double</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Witneſſes <hi>(Synopſ. Prophet. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>ſect.</hi> 7, 11.) one <hi>quoad ſpeciem,</hi> the other <hi>quoad gradus,</hi> you are to take notice, that that diſtinction is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by me <hi>only</hi> to this end, that no man ſhould expect at the Expiration of the forty two months an <hi>univerſal</hi> Riſing of the Witneſſes or <hi>total</hi> Fall of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> but only <hi>ſpeciminal.</hi> But that after this <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> Riſing I allow the following Victories of Chriſt againſt Antichriſt to be called the <hi>further Riſing</hi> of the Witneſſes. This, though by ſome Analogy it may be called (and is ſo by me called) a <hi>further gradual</hi> Riſing of the Witneſſes, yet I muſt confeſs I think it now more proper and ſafe to call nothing the Riſing of the Witneſſes but what is included within the Time of the forty two months, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the <hi>partial</hi> Fall of the City. Whatever other Acceſſions are made to the Kingdom of Chriſt under the Vials, muſt take their denomination from the Vial they happen under. And looking upon the thing it ſelf, thoſe that bore Teſtimony in thoſe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34043:140"/>Times that the <hi>Cauſe of Truth</hi> ſeemed ſo <hi>obſcure</hi> in, that none would <hi>owne</hi> it but thoſe Witneſſes, theſe, I ſay, have a more ſpecial Right to that Title. But the Cauſe is now plainly decided by the manifeſt Judgment of God in giving Victory to the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and fulfilling exquiſitely the Prophecy recorded <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.11. in the bleſſed <hi>Reformation.</hi> So that further witneſſing in a decided Cauſe ſeems ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, men now that ſtick to the Truth decided, are rather <hi>honeſt conſcientious Profeſſors</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> than <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to it, and they that ſuffer for it, may rather be ſaid to be <hi>murdered</hi> than <hi>martyred</hi> for the Truth, though the Merit of their Suffering is much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what alike to the other.</p>
               <p>And now in this proper ſenſe of the Riſing of the Witneſſes, when I ſay they are riſen above thirty years ago, this is no contradiction out of forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to my own ſentiments who make the Riſing of the Witneſſes to begin about the middle of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond month of the laſt Hexamenon or Semi-time, and end about the middle of the fifth from mine own <hi>Epocha, Anno</hi> 393. or 400. as if hereby I finiſhed their Riſing later than about the midſt of the fifth month of the laſt Hexamenon, and ſo differ about fifty years from my ſelf. For where I ſay above thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years ago, I ſpeak in the <hi>Language of them</hi> that by the twelve hundred and ſixty years will have ſo <hi>many years Extent</hi> ſignified. My meaning therefore is, that <hi>even</hi> according <hi>to them,</hi> granting that <hi>Extent</hi> to them, <hi>yet</hi> the Witneſſes are riſen above thirty years ago, counting from the right <hi>Epocha,</hi> ſo that there is no further fulfilling of that Prophecy. But though there is no more counting on any further <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions</hi> to the Kingdom of Chriſt under the Notion
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:34043:141"/>of <hi>the twelve hundred and ſixty days unexpired</hi> or <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> yet there is from the Effects of the Vials, as I have hinted already: but we go on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Semi-times</hi> are illuſtrated by the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe,</hi> (1) In that they are by changing them into twelve hundred and ſixty days or forty two months declared to be <hi>but three times and an half.</hi> And (2) it is declared by placing <hi>three days and an half</hi> at the cloſe of the Viſion of the Witneſſes, that they are the <hi>meaſure</hi> that the <hi>Events</hi> of the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> are to be computed by, that is, that a <hi>Semi-time</hi> is the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite,</hi> not a <hi>Month</hi> or <hi>Day.</hi> And withal we muſt remember that the <hi>Artifice</hi> of <hi>Concealment</hi> is as well intended in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> as the <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, Remember that the forty two months Reign of the Beaſt is not underſtood of his <hi>Reign at large,</hi> but of his <hi>proſperous belligerant</hi> Reign againſt the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> till their <hi>Riſing</hi> and the partial Fall of the City, ſo that theſe neceſſarily ſynchronize.</p>
               <p>Your Compariſon of the laſt ſtroke at the Tree felling the Tree is witty, but not ſo well fitted to this caſe. The Riſing of the Witneſſes, or falling of the City, is rather like the mowing of a Meadow, which is not ſaid to be mowed juſt at the laſt cut, as the Tree to be felled at the laſt ſtroke of the Ax, but it is mowed and a mowing all the time till the laſt Sithe-full: ſuch is the nature of the Riſing of the Witneſſes. Their Riſing was in ſucceſſion, not at one joint Jump, as the falling of the graſs is in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, not all at one ſtroke of the Sithe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Arithm. Apocalypt. pag.</hi> 382. I make the twelve hundred and ſixty days of the Witneſſes expire <hi>Anno</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:34043:141"/>1652. ſpeaking according to their Hypotheſis that underſtand the <hi>full Extent</hi> of ſo many years by them; <hi>yet,</hi> ſay I, they expired in the year 1652. from the true <hi>Epocha,</hi> though they were ſo to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and though we did not meaſure the time of the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> by <hi>Semi-times.</hi> But this is but one true Tale to ſay, they expired <hi>An.</hi> 1652. from the true <hi>Epocha,</hi> according to <hi>that</hi> Hypotheſis of <hi>ſome,</hi> but that the Witneſſes Riſing was paſt in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent year (from the ſaid <hi>Epocha</hi>) conſulting Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and meaſuring by <hi>Semi-times,</hi> or making a <hi>Semi-time</hi> the Unite. It's much you did not underſtand my meaning before.</p>
               <p>And whereas you conceive the Witneſſes could not be <hi>politically</hi> dead from the very beginning of the <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> that word [Political] was the beſt word I could hit on to oppoſe to [Natural] death. But it is to be underſtood in a larger meaning than to be groſly put out of Office. This Death, I mean, is <hi>gradual,</hi> and the <hi>firſt degree</hi> thereof is, when thoſe that ſtood up for the Truth againſt the introducing the Pagano-Chriſtian Rites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were found ſo weak, that they could not ſtop the Tide of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Corruptions flowing in, but their attempts were <hi>ineffectual,</hi> ſo that as to any <hi>efficiency</hi> to ſtop the incroaching Pagano-Chriſtianiſm, they were as mere <hi>Cyphers</hi> or <hi>dead men</hi> that can do nothing. This is included in [Political Death] in that large ſenſe I take it in. I mean this <hi>Inefficiency</hi> or <hi>Inability</hi> to carry on things that appertain to the Order or <hi>Polity</hi> of the Church, or of the State in Matters reſpecting Religion againſt the Authors and Countenancers of the growing Corruptions. And the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> being the very Wilderneſs of the Church, the Woman was
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:34043:142"/>in it as ſoon as it was. Theſe are Hints of an Anſwer to your former Letter, I ſhall offer the like to your latter.</p>

               <p>YOU underſtand aright what I mean by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>Semi-time</hi> (which I call alſo in one word an <hi>Hexamenon</hi>) an <hi>

And I have noted above that from my <hi>Epocha</hi> the Witneſſes began to riſe about the midſt of the <hi>ſecond</hi> month, and were riſing till about at leaſt the midſt of the <hi>fifth</hi> in the <hi>laſt Semi-time.</hi> And therefore it is no wonder that ſo large

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> as an <hi>Hexamenon</hi> or <hi>Hecatouogdocontheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> that is, an hundred and eighty Prophetick days ſhould be the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> by which ſo large an Event ſhould be computed. Nor is there any other <hi>even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> meaſure of Time ſignified by the forty two months or twelve hundred and ſixty days than <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>'s ſeven <hi>Semi-times,</hi> as I ſhall remind you again in the Concluſion. And it is not this <hi>partial</hi> Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſignified by the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> but that <hi>total Victory</hi> of the Rider of the white Horſe under the <hi>ſeventh Vial</hi> that ſecures the Saints for ever falling again under the power of the Beaſt. Now to your Paragraphs.</p>
               <p>To (1) In <hi>Synopſis Prophetica, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. there I ſay only, that the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Beaſt's forty two months is <hi>at leaſt</hi> ſo early as four hundred thirty two years; but the <hi>Epocha</hi> I ſtick to, is three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ninety three. And according to that <hi>Epocha</hi> the Riſing of the Witneſſes will begin about the middle of the ſecond month, and reach into at leaſt the middle of the fifth month of the laſt <hi>Hexamenon</hi> or <hi>Semi-time.</hi> And I ſay, that all the Variations of the time of the continuance of the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> ſignifie no more than that they ſhall continue for <hi>ſeven Semi-times,</hi> which are the <hi>ſeven <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nites</hi> in this Compute. And therefore if the Continuance reach into the ſeventh <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> (eſpecially the Event aimed at filling that Unite ſo competently well as it does, <hi>viz.</hi> the Riſing of the Witneſſes and partial Fall of the great City) the fulfilling of the Prophecy is plain and exact.</p>
               <p>To (2) What you ſay here is neat, ſuppoſing your <hi>Epocha</hi> of four hundred fifty ſix years, when the Beaſt became ten-horned, were true. For then <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:34043:143"/>beginning the Reformation would fall ſhort of the ſeventh <hi>Semi-time.</hi> But I ſtand to that <hi>one Epocha</hi> of <hi>three hundred ninety three</hi> years, according to which the Riſing of the Witneſſes will begin about the middle of the ſecond month of the laſt <hi>Hexame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> or <hi>Half-time,</hi> and reach into the midſt of the fifth month at leaſt. So that the <hi>Half-Time</hi> is added to the <hi>three Times</hi> to very good purpoſe in <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To (3) The little Horn <hi>prevailed</hi> againſt the Saints for a time and times and half a time; but in the laſt Half-time he was not ſo <hi>prevalent</hi> or <hi>proſperous</hi> in his War, but that part of his Kingdom was given to the Saints in the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> as it is ſaid <hi>Dan. Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>And they ſhall take away his Kingdom,</hi> which was in part done in the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> and Fall of the tenth part of the City, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Reformation;</hi> but the <hi>conſuming</hi> and <hi>deſtroying it to the end</hi> is left to the <hi>Vials</hi> that ſucceed the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and will be completed under the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> at that great Battel under the Conduct of the <hi>Heros</hi> on the white Horſe with a Sword iſſuing out of his mouth. And the <hi>Vials</hi> ſucceed the ſixth Trumpet, and conſequently the Time and Times and Half a Time. Which <hi>Vials</hi> would have no Kingdom of the Beaſt left to be poured upon, if the fulfilling of the Viſion of the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> and Fall of the City were more than <hi>partial.</hi> What can be more plain?</p>
               <p>To (4) After three days and an half, or after three times and an half, doubtleſs is to be underſtood of the Three and Half <hi>current,</hi> not <hi>expired.</hi> But this Expreſſion [After] does plainly aſſure us, that this is the <hi>final</hi> iſſue of that forty two months War of the Beaſt with the Witneſſes, and that the <hi>final</hi> iſſue of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:34043:143"/>that War is but a partial Fall of the City, and no more Riſing of the Witneſſes than was commenſurate thereto, I pray you think ſeriouſly on that. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining of the tenth part of the Kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt into the hands of Chriſt, and the Riſing of the Witneſſes in that tenth part, is plainly the <hi>final</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the forty two months (that is, of the Time and Times and half a Time) War of the Beaſt with the Witneſſes. The Viſion ſays ſo expreſly.</p>
               <p>As for your <hi>Anſwer</hi> to my ſecond <hi>Query;</hi> It is not my <hi>Query</hi> you anſwer to. For my Query is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the forty two months <hi>proſperous</hi> War of the Beaſt does not ſynchronize with the firſt ſix Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and you give your Anſwer touching the Reign or War of the Beaſt <hi>at large;</hi> which indeed reigns ſtill, and wars ſtill, but not with like continued ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as in the forty two months continued War noted in the Viſion.</p>
               <p>In Anſwer to my <hi>ſixth</hi> Query, it's a pretty inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious uſe you make of the Prophetick <hi>Henopoeia,</hi> and I acknowledge there is a Prophetick <hi>Henopoeia</hi> in this part of the Viſion, the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> For though in the fulfilling of the Prediction the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes roſe in <hi>ſeveral places</hi> and at <hi>ſeveral times ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively</hi> one part after another, and with ſome <hi>Intervals</hi> of time betwixt, though ſtill within the laſt <hi>Semi-time,</hi> yet by an <hi>Henopoeia</hi> all theſe Riſings are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as <hi>one</hi> Riſing, this is acknowledged. But here we are carefully to obſerve, that all theſe Riſings put together is by the Viſion it ſelf reſtrained to a <hi>partial</hi> Riſing, foraſmuch as it is ſaid, That the <hi>tenth part</hi> (at the ſelf ſame hour) of the great City fell, and it is moſt certain the Riſing was extended no further than the falling of the City. But this <hi>partial</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:34043:144"/>Fall and Riſing was after the three days and an half, and conſequently after the forty two months and twelve hundred and ſixty days equipollent only to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s three Times and an half or ſeven <hi>Semi-times,</hi> and the Reformation is this partial Fall of the City and Riſing of the Witneſſes commenſurate thereto, nor any other than a <hi>partial</hi> Reformation is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Prophecy; wherefore the <hi>Reformation</hi> being ſaid to fall out after the three days and an <hi>half current,</hi> it is hence evident that both the <hi>Reformation</hi> is the <hi>final</hi> iſſue of the three Times and an half's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous War of the Beaſt, and that we are to reckon the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> (the time of their Event) by <hi>Semi-times,</hi> the <hi>Reformation</hi> being both begun and ended within the laſt <hi>Semi-time,</hi> and taking ſo large a ſpace therein. This wants nothing but freely and cloſely thinking of, and it will appear as clear as the Sun. If the Riſing of the Witneſſes were <hi>univerſal,</hi> or there were a <hi>total</hi> Fall of the great City at the cloſe of the ſixth Trumpet when this is, foraſmuch as the Vials certainly follow the ſixth Trumpet, there would yet be then no Kingdom of the Beaſt left for them to be poured upon, as I noted above. Think ſeriouſly on this.</p>

But I abſolutely deny that thoſe Victories belong to the forty two months War, or that they are (if we ſpeak properly, and keep to the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> ſtile) to be called the Riſing of the Witneſſes, but are to take their denomination from the <hi>Vials</hi> they happen under.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas you ſay, it does not appear to you difficult at all to determine, whether the <hi>two-horned</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:34043:145"/>or <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beaſt be the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Head or <hi>eighth</hi> King; I ſay it is impoſſible the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beaſt ſhould be the eighth King or ſeventh Head; becauſe the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is not his <hi>Head.</hi> But it is a figurative Speech when it is ſaid, <hi>The Beaſt that was and is not he is the eighth.</hi> By a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> the <hi>whole Beaſt</hi> is put for <hi>part, viz.</hi> his <hi>Head.</hi> Therefore the Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition is not betwixt the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beaſt and <hi>Ten-horned,</hi> that is, betwixt the <hi>Whore</hi> or <hi>Apoſtatized Hierarchy</hi> and the <hi>Empire</hi> divided into ten King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but betwixt the ſaid <hi>Hierarchy</hi> and the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatizing Caeſars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There was an <hi>Hierarchical</hi> apoſtatizing Head ſo ſoon as the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> came in, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beaſt, the ſame with the <hi>Whore</hi> that <hi>rides</hi> and <hi>guides</hi> the Beaſt, and therefore has the Office of an <hi>Head,</hi> as I noted in my former. And <hi>Vigilantius</hi> who lived about the end of the fourth Century, how he was againſt the worſhipping of the Relicks of Martyrs, how he ſaid the Miracles done at their Monuments were the preſtigious deluſion of Devils, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned alſo the burning of Wax-Candles at their Altars in the day-time, and how ſharply he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed againſt by S. <hi>Jerome</hi> for this, is too too well known in Hiſtory. Theſe <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Superſtitions therefore coming in, and being thus countenanced by the lapſing Hierarchy, and the Hierarchy being the Head of the Empire <hi>quoad Spiritualia,</hi> it is plain there is a Pagano-Chriſtian Head ſo ſoon as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie</hi> came in. And it is the two-horned Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. that is the Maker of the Image of the Beaſt, And as for the little Horn appearing <hi>after</hi> the ten Horns in <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 7. it is ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 8. that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared or came up <hi>amongst</hi> them. Nor is he ſaid to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:34043:145"/>come up after them, <hi>v.</hi> 20. and <hi>v.</hi> 24. where he is ſaid to riſe <hi>after</hi> them: from the Greek and Hebrew it may ſignifie no more than <hi>behind</hi> them, he ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his growth upon them and with them; or it may refer to the time of his more eminent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous growth, reſpecting by an <hi>Idiconoea</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> chiefly. And though the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Riſe</hi> of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beaſt follow that of the Ten-horned Beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. yet the Method of thus placing them is good, the Effect being <hi>notius nobis</hi> than the Cauſe. Wherefore this ſtrange <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of the Re-paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Empire is repreſented in the firſt place, and the <hi>Efficient cauſe</hi> thereof the <hi>Apoſtatical Hierarchy</hi> in the ſecond, which is the <hi>two-horned Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Maker</hi> of the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Pagan Beaſt,</hi> which the <hi>ten-horned</hi> is. So eaſie is it to conceive an <hi>Hierarchical</hi> Pagano-Chriſtian Head at leaſt in order of Nature before a <hi>Caeſarean.</hi> But there is no likelihood but the <hi>Caeſars</hi> Religion was immediately conformed to the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hierarchy all along, and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> you know makes the <hi>two-horned</hi> and <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beaſts to <hi>ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronize.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Now for the Chriſtian <hi>Caeſars</hi> continuing pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian for an hundred twenty years, according to <hi>my own account,</hi> this is an odd paſſage and to be wondred at, and contrary to what I preciſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs in the place you allude to. <hi>Synopſ. Prophet. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Conſect.</hi> 2. and <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. where are theſe very words: <hi>But what I leave more lax here will be more particularly bounded in the proportion of the Inner and Outer Court of the Temple, which will gird in this time a little within four hundred years.</hi> And do not three hundred ninety three years do ſo? Which is the <hi>Epocha</hi> I ſtand to.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:34043:146"/>
               <p n="5">5. That is alſo ſomewhat harſhly ſaid, That it does not ſo much as appear <hi>probable</hi> that the Chriſtian <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> complied with the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> of the Church from the beginning thereof; whenas it was their <hi>Interest</hi> to comply with that which had the more common vogue of Holineſs in the Empire. But it appears <hi>de facto</hi> to be true: Elſe why did <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the Emperours in <hi>Vigilantius</hi> his time not ſide with him againſt the ſway of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beaſt, ſo much given in thoſe times to the Superſtitious and even Idolatrous Veneration of the Reliques of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs? Where is there one Edict to ſtop the current of Superſtition and Idolatry in the whole Succeſſion of Emperours from <hi>Theodoſius M.</hi> his time till <hi>Leo Iſaurus</hi> the Iconoclaſt? But they were all aſleep till at laſt they ſeemed to be awakened by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God in the Invaſion of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> I mean <hi>Leo Iſaurus</hi> and ſome of his Succeſſors. Is it not a marvellous thing that <hi>Valentinianus, Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius</hi> ſhould be ſo curious as in their Edicts to take notice of the hair of Deaconeſſes, and ſay nothing againſt the <hi>exorbitant.</hi> Veneration of <hi>Martyrs</hi> and their <hi>Reliques,</hi> unleſs they complied therewith? And how eaſie was it for the Chriſtian Emperours in thoſe days to ſwallow down with ſweetneſs all that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Devotion towards the Martyrs and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, who did not diſguſt, but aſſume ſuch ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Titles as theſe to themſelves, <hi>Noſtrum Numen,</hi>

And as the Superſtition and Idolatry in worſhipping the Saints and their Reliques increaſed, ſo did this <hi>Political</hi> Idolatry toward the Emperours Images. For as the above-named <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredus</hi> cites it out of the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the people, when thoſe Imperial Images were ſent into the Provinces, met them with <hi>Tapers</hi> and <hi>Incenſe,</hi> as if it were the Image of ſome God. What ſcruple therefore is there now left but the Emperours ſwam down in the common ſtream of Superſtition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry from the firſt Apoſtaſie of the Church to <hi>Leo Iſaurus</hi>'s time, and that therefore from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> till the <hi>Pope</hi> play'd the <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and would be above the Emperours, the <hi>Emperours themſelves</hi> were the <hi>Pagano-Chriſtian</hi> Head of the Beaſt.</p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:34043:147"/>
               <p>And yet that the Emperours were more <hi>poſitively</hi> active in the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> of the Church, appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of Hiſtory. For to omit <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (who with an innocent zeal towards the Martyrs, cauſed the holy Reliques of <hi>Andrew, Luke</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> to be with pompous Solemnity tranſlated to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> there to be entempled in more illuſtrious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; though <hi>Cyril</hi> againſt <hi>Julian</hi> plainly ſhows, that the moſt famous Temples of the Heathen were in truth no other than the <hi>Sepulchres</hi> or <hi>Monuments</hi> of the <hi>dead;</hi> but <hi>Conſtantine</hi> intended nothing but a kind of civil Honour hereby to the ſaid Martyrs:) <hi>Arcadius</hi> alſo in a time when the generality of the Empire grew <hi>mad after</hi> the <hi>Reliques</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> (having a ſuperſtitious confidence of <hi>ſtrange Virtue</hi> in them, of preſerving them from Evil and the place where they were entempled) ordered the Bones of the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> to be tranſlated out of <hi>Judaea</hi> into <hi>Thrace</hi> with marvellous Pomp, the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Reliques of the Prophet with <hi>Adoration,</hi> but not to him forſooth, but Chriſt, as S. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſays, and is the preſent excuſe of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> at this day. And how active <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was in tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Reliques to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> you may ſee in <hi>Spondanus</hi> and others. And that of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> here is alſo worth the noting: <hi>Videtis Imperii nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimi eminentiſſimum Culmen ad ſepulchrum Piſcatoris</hi> Petri <hi>ſubmiſſo diademate ſupplicare.</hi> So that it is plain the Emperours went along with the practice of the Church and People.</p>
               <p>Nay, as to the ordering of the Reliques of Saints and Martyrs and the tranſlation of them in thoſe Times, nothing was to be done <hi>ſine affatibus Auguſti,</hi> without the permiſſion of the Emperour. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:34043:147"/>
                  <hi>Theodoſius M.</hi> made an Edict againſt the vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond Monks ſelling of Reliques, but therein allows the entempling of them with all Magnificence: which yet plainly <hi>anſwers</hi> to the entempling the <hi>Pagan He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes.</hi> As the <hi>Athenians</hi> after the <hi>Spectrum</hi> of <hi>Theſeus</hi> had appeared fighting for them in the Plains of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rathon,</hi> were bid by their Oracle to find out the <hi>Bones</hi> of <hi>Theſeus</hi> and bring them to <hi>Athens,</hi> and to build an <hi>Heroon</hi> to him or Temple, and give him Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip, that thereby he might become the <hi>Safeguard</hi> of their State and City. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> alſo frequented the Sepulchre of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> with great Devotion, becauſe they conceited he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them from Aſps and Crocodiles. And the Succeſſours of <hi>Alexander</hi> ſtrove who ſhould tranſlate his Body into their Dominions, and build an <hi>Heroon</hi> to him, as deeming thereby that they ſhould engage him to be a Defence or Safeguard to their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>This is the genuine meaning of the <hi>Pagans</hi> entem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling the <hi>Bones</hi> or <hi>Bodies</hi> of their <hi>Heroes.</hi> And this was the Conceit of the generality of Chriſtians to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the latter end of the fourth Century, and the beginning of the fifth, that the <hi>Reliques</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> in their <hi>Martyria</hi> or places they were <hi>entempled</hi> in, were the <hi>Forts, Bulwarks,</hi> and the <hi>Defenders</hi> of the City and Country where they were enſhrined. This was not only the ordinary Conceit of the common people, but the voice of the Fathers in publick Sermons in thoſe Times. Whence we may be ſure the Emperours (having ſuch a deference for the Biſhops, eſpecially <hi>Theodoſius M.</hi>) were ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively imbued with the ſame ſenſe of things, which yet is no leſs than to be guilty of the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:34043:148"/>
                  <hi>Mahuzzim,</hi> in thus repoſing their confidence in them, when no <hi>inviſible</hi> Power is to be confided in but God alone. See <hi>Chemnitius</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, The Care of Religion belonging alſo to the Emperours (though they mainly intruſted the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> with it) and they giving no check by any Edict or Reſcript from <hi>Theodoſius M.</hi> his time to <hi>Leo Iſaurus,</hi> as I noted above, this <hi>not</hi> forbidding is plainly <hi>encouraging,</hi> commanding or aſſuring them in this erroneous way; as he that rides an Horſe and has the reins in his hands, is ſuppoſed to approve of the way the Horſe goes, if he checks him not with the bridle, and ſo direct him into the right way. So that the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> thus begun under the Emperours, it is manifeſt they ſtand guilty thereof, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Apoſtatical or Pagano-Chriſtian Heads of the Beaſt ſo ſoon as the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> began. Which is the thing that was to be demonſtrated.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And that the forty two months War of the Beaſt commenced as early as the Apoſtaſie, may be eaſily underſtood by any body that underſtands the Genius of the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Stile, which is <hi>highly figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> and of a <hi>lofty vigorous ſenſe-ſtriking</hi> ſtrain, uſing the fulleſt and ſtrongeſt Metaphors; and therefore it is no wonder that all the Conteſt and Tug betwixt the Apoſtatizing Empire and the Witneſſes from the beginning to the end of the Conteſt, is ſet out by that one <hi>high-ſounding</hi> Word or Phraſe of <hi>War;</hi> though at firſt it was only a Diſpute and Conteſt in words, as in the Caſe of S. <hi>Jerome</hi> and <hi>Vigilantius:</hi> And the Metaphor is ſo <hi>eaſie</hi> and natural, though ſo <hi>grandiſonant,</hi> that our <hi>Theological Controverſies</hi> and Diſputes are ordinarily called <hi>Polemical</hi> Divinity, that is in plain Engliſh, <hi>Warring</hi> or <hi>Warlike</hi> Divinity.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:34043:148"/>And this War is not ſaid to be betwixt the <hi>Head</hi> of the Beaſt and the Witneſſes (as if the War could not begin till the Head of the Beaſt poſitively oppoſed the Witneſſes) but betwixt the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;</hi> ſo that even while there was no Edict of the Emperours againſt the Witneſſes, yet the War might be begun and continued betwixt the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and the <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> unleſs a man will be ſo humourſom, as in the Fight of an <hi>Horſe</hi> with a <hi>Bear,</hi> becauſe the Horſe bites not with his head, but only kicks with his heels, to deny he fights with the Bear. And yet how poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively the Emperours did concur with the Apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing part of the Empire, has been declared above.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That the Beaſt was in being before the ten Kings roſe in the Empire, is demonſtrated from your own Conceſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was <hi>before</hi> the <hi>ten Kings roſe</hi> in the Empire. For the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> into <hi>Pagano-Chriſtianiſm</hi> is that very <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Eſſence</hi> that turned the Empire into that ſtate which the Prophetick Stile calls, <hi>The Beaſt that was, is not, and yet is.</hi> And its being divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten Kingdoms, confers no more to its being a Beaſt, than quartering a ſlain Mutton into four quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by a Butcher, contributes to its being a ſlain Mutton, which it was as fully before. So that this Diviſion in neither caſe is a <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> of the thing being ſo. Nor does it follow becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatized Empire is repreſented by the Beaſt with ten Horns crowned, that therefore it was not a Beaſt before thoſe ten-crowned Horns, no more than it follows that the Apoſtatized Hierarchy repreſented by the Whore, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. ſo drunk with the blood of the Saints, and ſo gorgeouſly apparelled, was not a Whore till ſhe was grown ſo <hi>extremely</hi> ſumptuous in
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:34043:149"/>her <hi>Ornaments,</hi> and <hi>barbarouſly</hi> cruel in her <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The uſe of the <hi>ten Horns crowned</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. is not to ſignifie it was not a Beaſt <hi>till</hi> thoſe <hi>actually crowned Horns,</hi> but to diſtinguiſh him from the <hi>Dragon</hi> with ten Horns <hi>uncrowned, Chap.</hi> 12. and ſo to intimate that this Beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. is a Repreſentation of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire after it had degenerated into a <hi>Pagano-Chriſtian State.</hi> For the Diviſion of the Empire into ten King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms was not till after it had become Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And laſtly, As for your Poſtſcript: I do not ground my diſtinction of the Beaſt's forty two months <hi>proſperous</hi> Reign from his <hi>Reign at large</hi> upon the different Readings of <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5. but prove that their Reading that read <hi>v.</hi> 5. That power was given him to make forty two months War with the Saints, or that he was to proceed proſperouſly, or do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly forty two months (and not to <hi>continue</hi> at large) is the beſt and trueſt ſenſe. As is proved in the Preface to the <hi>Anſwer to the Remarks.</hi> I ſay that Reading or ſenſe I contend for, is not <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> but <hi>proved;</hi> foraſmuch as the iſſue, even the <hi>final</hi> iſſue of that War is but a <hi>partial</hi> Fall of the City and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent Riſing of the Witneſſes. I pray conſider the ſixth, ſeventh and eighth Queries and the Notes on them, and I think it will be impoſſible for you not to be convinced.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. TO your firſt Paragraph I ſay, That which falls out after the War of forty two months, equal and Synchronal to the three days and an half, to the three Times and an Half, and to the reſt that ſynchronize with theſe, and is the iſſue of this forty two months War is the <hi>final</hi> iſſue thereof. But the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> falls out as the iſſue of that War betwixt the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>them</hi> after the three
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:34043:150"/>days and an half (equal and Synchronal to the forty two months) according to the expreſs intimation of the Text, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.11. Wherefore the Riſing of the Witneſſes commenſurate to the partial Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> or of the great City, is the <hi>final</hi> iſſue of the forty two months War of the Beaſt againſt the Saints and Witneſſes, according to the expreſs indication of the Viſion. This is the <hi>final</hi> iſſue of the forty two months War which cloſes with the <hi>Exit</hi> of the ſixth Trumpet which the <hi>Vials follow,</hi> and are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a further Ruine of the Beaſt afterwards. So that this ſo plain a Truth is not inconſiſtent with the regaining of larger ſhares, nay the whole Kingdom of Antichriſt into Chriſt's own hands again. And theſe firſt Acquiſts are as it were the <hi>Primitiae</hi> and <hi>Pledges</hi> thereof. So plain is it every way that this Viſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. touching the Witneſſes, drives only at a <hi>partial</hi> regaining of the Kingdom of Antichriſt into the hands of Chriſt. The Judgment indeed is here begun of the little Horn, they begin to take away his Dominion, but conſuming and deſtroying it even unto the end, that is the work of the <hi>Vials.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To your ſecond. Bring by a Prophetick <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoeia</hi> as many Riſings of the Witneſſes, and as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in time and place as you will, and phanſie them as ſtrongly as you will to be made within the laſt Semi-time, or before the forty two months, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your <hi>Epocha,</hi> be expired; yet the Viſion does expreſly declare, that all this can amount to no more than the Fall of the tenth part of the City <hi>Babylon,</hi> and a commenſurate Riſing of the Witneſſes. Upon which conſideration one would think it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but you ſhould find your ſelf in a wrong Box, and that my way is the genuine Interpretation
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:34043:150"/>of the Prophecy. But that your <hi>Epocha</hi> is alſo falſe, is abundantly made out from what we have ſaid to your third Letter, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Beaſt and his War with the Witneſſes commenced as early as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie which your ſelf acknowledges to begin about four hundred years after Chriſt, which is above fifty years earlier than your <hi>Epocha.</hi> This, if you tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly conſider it, is a full Anſwer to whatever you offer in your ſecond Paragraph. And it is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to me to multiply words.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the third. This invincible Reaſoning of mine touching this Viſion you ſeem to be aware of in this next Paragraph, and yet you are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently pierced by it, but would ſhuffle it off by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, If the Event of this forty two months War be but <hi>partial,</hi> how can it be <hi>final,</hi> as if there were an inconſiſtency therein, becauſe the one ſignifies there is more of the ſame kind to follow, whereas <hi>final</hi> ſignifies the contrary? <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this is a mere piece of Sophiſtry; The pretended inconſiſtency not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Laws of real Oppoſition, which muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the ſame thing. But <hi>final</hi> here reſpects the <hi>Extenſion</hi> of the forty two months War, but <hi>partial,</hi> the <hi>Extenſion</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> the Witneſſes or Saints warred againſt, the vanquiſhing of part whereof may well be the <hi>final</hi> reſult of the forty two months War or of the Time and Times and half a Times War, though there may be more of the ſame Kingdom ſtill behind to be conquered and ſubdued. This is ſo open a Fallacy, that it needs no illuſtration to ſet off the inconſequence thereof. But you proceed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To your next I anſwer briefly, That [After three days and an half, or three times and an half] I underſtand to ſignifie as much as, After the laſt
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:34043:151"/>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite,</hi> of the Eventual Computation, <hi>current,</hi> which is a Semi-time, as I have demonſtrated in my <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metica Apocalyptica,</hi> and more conciſely in my <hi>Nine Queries</hi> and <hi>Notes.</hi> And a <hi>Semi-time</hi> being the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> in <hi>Eventual</hi> Compute, and ſo <hi>adapted</hi> to the nature of the <hi>Event</hi> predicted, too big for either a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>Day</hi> or <hi>Month;</hi> and not the beginning of the Event, but the whole Event it ſelf being the <hi>Object</hi> of the <hi>Prediction,</hi> and the whole Event reaching from about the midſt of the ſecond month of the laſt <hi>Hexamenon</hi> or <hi>Semi-time</hi> into the fifth, if not ſixth thereof, the Accompliſhment of the Prediction is as exquiſite and complete, as if the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> in Compute had been a <hi>Year,</hi> and the Event had fallen out after the laſt year <hi>current</hi> of ſuppoſe twelve hundred and ſixty years. This, if you conſider it, is a plain and full Anſwer to what you alledge in this Paragraph.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the next many things are ſaid, but nothing that in the leaſt infringes that grand Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>final</hi> iſſue of the forty two months War betwixt the Beaſt and the Witneſſes is only the Fall of the tenth part of the City and the Riſing of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes proportionate thereto. You readily grant that the <hi>Vials ſucceed the ſixth Trumpet,</hi> but you ſay, that the <hi>Vials</hi> ſucceed the three Times and an half, does not thence follow, unleſs I had firſt proved that the Three times and an Half reached no further than to the end of the ſixth Trumpet, which you ſay you never yet ſaw proved. This I wonder at, becauſe Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has ſufficiently demonſtrated, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be nouriſhed for a <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>half a Time</hi> in the Wilderneſs, ſynchronizeth with the firſt ſix Trumpets. Conſult his Table of <hi>Synchroniſms,</hi> and you will ſee it, and peruſe his little Treatiſe of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:34043:151"/>Synchroniſms, and there you will find it proved. Beſides that, till after the <hi>three days</hi> and <hi>an Half</hi> the ſecond Wo, or ſixth Trumpet is not paſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. And this is a plain demonſtration that the <hi>final</hi> iſſue of the forty two months War is but a partial Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> or partial Ruine of the Kingdom of the Beaſt and not a <hi>total,</hi> becauſe there would be no Beaſt left to be ruined by the <hi>Vials</hi> after the Expiration of the ſixth Trumpet and laſt Semi-time. Think ſeriouſly on this.</p>
               <p>You ſay the three Woes have the ſame ſubject and the ſame object, which is a miſtake. For the firſt two Woes are the Invaſion of the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> upon the Idolatrous Empire at large the Ten-horned Beaſt, and belong to the <hi>Sealed Book</hi> Prophecy, but the third Wo more peculiarly reſpects the <hi>two horned</hi> Beaſt or <hi>Idolatrous Hierarchy,</hi> and belongs to the <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy. But all three agree in this, that they are <hi>Woes,</hi> and ſo the tranſition is from one Wo to another. But that proves not that they have one <hi>adequate Subject</hi> and <hi>Object,</hi> no more than that they belong to one and the ſame Prophecy, whenas it is manifeſt the laſt Wo belongs to the <hi>Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Book</hi>-Prophecy, the other two to the <hi>Sealed.</hi> Nor is the laſt Wo-Trumpet divided adequately into <hi>ſeven Vials,</hi> but into <hi>ſeven Thunders,</hi> and the <hi>first Thunder</hi> into the <hi>ſeven Vials:</hi> which is needleſs here to inſiſt on, and you may find ſatisfaction elſewhere. See the <hi>Anſwer to the Remarks</hi> on the place, and alſo <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicula Apocalyptica.</hi> So that there is not the leaſt pretence of continuing the forty two months War betwixt the Beaſt and the Witneſſes beyond the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> Fall of the great City and the Riſing of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes proportionate thereunto.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:34043:152"/>
               <p>That there is ſtill a ſtruggle betwixt the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> and <hi>Evangelical</hi> Party, and that the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Party may ſometimes receive damage, is true: yet this is not to be reckoned to the forty two months War, but to take denomination from other Viſions or Prophecies, from the <hi>Menaces</hi> to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and from the <hi>Vials</hi> eſpecially. And their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks to do the Evangelical Party miſchief, is to be referred to their noiſom and grievous ſore as an effect thereof <hi>inflicted</hi> on them under the <hi>first</hi> Vial, and <hi>ſticking</hi> to them, or at leaſt irritable in them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; as this ſore is mentioned even in the <hi>fifth</hi> Vial. And when ſo horrible a War was raiſed againſt the Evangelical Party here in <hi>England</hi> in Eighty eight, and that by the great Providence of God they were ſo defeated; this is referrible to the <hi>third</hi> Vial. And if in the midſt of the ſedulous Attacks of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Party, ſome mighty Potentate in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould by God's Providence be raiſed up in their behalf, the hearts of Kings being in the hand of God, this were referrible to the <hi>fourth</hi> Vial. But according to the Apocalyptick Stile, this is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted neither any part of the forty two months War, nor of the Riſing of the Witneſſes. It is ſomething tedious to inſiſt on things ſo plain.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In your ſixth Paragraph you lay great ſtreſs upon that Paſſage <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.17. touching the ten Kings that God has put into their hearts to fulfil his Will, and to agree and give their Kingdom to the Beaſt until the words of God ſhall be fulfilled, which words of God you underſtand of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy of the little Horn having the Saints given into his hands until a Time and Times and dividing of a Time; And of thoſe other words of <hi>Daniel,</hi> where
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:34043:152"/>he ſays, I beheld, and the ſame Horn made War with the Saints, and <hi>prevailed</hi> againſt them until the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of days came, and Judgment was given to the Saints of the moſt High, and the time came that the Saints poſſeſſed the Kingdom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.21, 22. and then you skip from <hi>v.</hi> 22. to <hi>v.</hi> 27. adding, And what Kingdom that is he tells in the following words (but they follow a great way off) The Kingdom and Dominion and the greatneſs of the Kingdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole Heaven. And you ſay, you ſuppoſe, I will not ſay this Kingdom is ſo given and poſſeſſed yet; and if not, how can you ſay the little Horns <hi>making War</hi> with the Saints, and <hi>prevailing</hi> againſt them for a time and times and half a time, is expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? I pray you, Sir, think ſeriouſly on this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Well, I have thought ſeriouſly on it, and find what you lay ſuch great ſtreſs on, has no ſtrength in it at all. I eaſily admit thoſe words of <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.17. may allude to theſe paſſages of <hi>Daniel.</hi> But there is nothing here that infers that the forty two months War of the Beaſt with the Saints extends any further than the partial Fall of the great City, and the then commenſurate Riſing of the Witneſſes. Which Time I call the <hi>proſperous</hi> Reign and War of the Beaſt, which are the Time and Times and half a Time here mentioned in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and in which Fall the laſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-time current he made War, and <hi>prevailed</hi> againſt the Saints, as <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo has foretold. And this was till the Ancient of Days came, and Judgment was given to the Saints of the moſt High, <hi>v.</hi> 22. which is further explained <hi>v.</hi> 26. (which you wiſely skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped over) But the Judgment ſhall ſit, and they ſhall take away his (<hi>viz.</hi> the little Horn's) Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not all of it at once (as it was not at the Fall of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:34043:153"/>the tenth part of the City and commenſurate Riſing of the Witneſſes) but leiſurely by degrees. Which Apocalyptick Viſion therefore is an excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on this Text of <hi>Daniel.</hi> God has adjudged the Cauſe to the Evangelical Party by this <hi>partial</hi> Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and the then Riſing of the Witneſſes. This taking away <hi>part</hi> of the little Horn's Dominion, is a <hi>Pledge</hi> of the having it <hi>conſumed and deſtroyed even to the end.</hi> But this deſtruction and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is not the iſſue of the forty two months War, wherein the Beaſt <hi>prevailed</hi> for ſuch a time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Saints, but at laſt he was <hi>partially</hi> van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, but it is the reſult of the <hi>Effuſion</hi> of the <hi>Vials;</hi> ſo that things that lay ſo cloſe wrapt up in <hi>Daniel,</hi> are thus diſtinctly and explicitely ſet out in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> and the Explication found to be the eaſie and natural ſenſe of <hi>Daniel.</hi> Do not wink wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt Truth, and you will eaſily diſcern it. See my Expoſition of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s ſecond Viſion on this place, <hi>v.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>And though this is ſo eaſily anſwered, yet you are earneſt with me again at the cloſe of your Letter to obſerve that the Time, Times and half a Time reach as far as till the Ancient of Days ſhall come, and till the Judgment ſhall be given to the Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which thing I grant you, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Time and Times and half a Time of the Horns <hi>prevailing</hi> War againſt the Saints, did reach ſo far till the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of Days gave him ſo notorious a check and counterbuff in the <hi>partial</hi> Fall of the City and the then Riſing of the Witneſſes. This was the <hi>final</hi> iſſue of the forty two months <hi>once</hi> proſperous War of the little Horn or Beaſt againſt the Saints. Which Time and Times and half a Time is no where mentioned
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:34043:153"/>in the Viſion of <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 7. but in <hi>v.</hi> 25. then comes that in the 26. verſe, which is evidently to be expounded as I have above expounded it, That upon the Judgment being ſet. his Dominion <hi>in part</hi> was taken away in the <hi>partial</hi> Fall of the great City, to which the Time and Times and half a Time do reach and comprize in the laſt <hi>Semi-time.</hi> This is the iſſue of the three days and an half's War or ſeven Semi-times War of the little Horn or the Beaſt with the Saints. But the <hi>conſuming</hi> and <hi>deſtroying</hi> his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion <hi>to the end,</hi> that is the work of the ſeven <hi>Vials,</hi> which being done, then it follows <hi>v.</hi> 27. And the Kingdom and Dominion and the greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven ſhall be given to the Saints of the moſt High. For then is the deſcent of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> in oppoſition to the great City of <hi>Babylon</hi> now quite aboliſhed, and after comes in the bleſſed <hi>Millennial</hi> Reign of Chriſt upon Earth, which is the greatneſs of his Kingdom under the whole Heaven. All which glorious Providences you would <hi>crumple</hi> up within the three Times and an half, whenas it is demonſtrated in Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> that the three Times and an half reach but to the <hi>Exit</hi> of the <hi>ſixth</hi> Trumpet, which you acknowledge the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Vials</hi> to <hi>follow.</hi> Conſider ſeriouſly theſe things. But to proceed to the ſeventh Paragraph.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Here I only briefly advertiſe you, that the firſt appearance of the Riſing of the Witneſſes, falling ſome eighteen years ſhort of the laſt Semi-time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>your Epocha,</hi> or not reaching it by eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, that this is a greater Argument againſt the truth of your <hi>Epocha,</hi> than againſt my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that a <hi>Semi-time</hi> is the only Authentick <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> in the <hi>Eventual</hi> Computation of the <hi>Medial Viſions.</hi> For
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:34043:154"/>according to your <hi>Epocha</hi> the Riſing of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will not begin after the ſeventh Semi-time current but before it, which is expreſly againſt the Text [After three days and an half] which abſurdity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſalved but by making the entire Reſurrection of the Witneſſes the adequate Object of the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſo it will reach about ſeventy years at leaſt into the laſt <hi>Semi-time</hi> or <hi>Hexamenon,</hi> that is, into the third month thereof; Though this is but a defectuous ſcambling thing in compariſon of what falls out according to the true <hi>Epocha</hi> I have pitched upon. But that your <hi>Epocha</hi> is falſe, I have in my former demonſtrated, it being not pitched in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> and of the War of the Beaſt with the Witneſſes. And in the mean time you ſee plainly, even according to your own <hi>Epocha,</hi> that the <hi>ſeventh Semi-time</hi> is not ſuperfluous, and that the reckoning not by <hi>Years,</hi> but by <hi>Semi-times,</hi> is neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And now eighthly, Whereas you ſay you hope the more the time of the End of the Churches affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from her Enemies draws near, the more God will ſtir up here and there ſome to look more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently into thoſe Divine Prophecies which tell us <hi>how long</hi> and no <hi>longer</hi> it ſhall laſt, and to enlighten his people that they better underſtand them for the encouragement and conſolation of his Church: I do not queſtion but this may be a pleaſing and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hope in you. But if this reſpect any of the <hi>Numbers</hi> of the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> (and the true <hi>Epocha</hi> of the two thouſand and three hundred Evening-Mornings in <hi>Daniel</hi> taken in a <hi>Typical</hi> ſenſe, defers the cleanſing of the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> till about four hundred years hence) I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs I think your
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:34043:154"/>hope is groundleſs, for any one to tell to a year or thereabout from any of the <hi>Medial</hi> Numbers when the affliction of the Church ſhall ceaſe. And my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are theſe,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That computing from the true <hi>Epocha</hi> (as I have proved it) the <hi>Medial</hi> Numbers twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty days or forty two months expired above thirty years ago.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The number of three days and an half, or three times and an half Synchronal to the twelve hundred and ſixty days or forty two months are aſſigned to indicate only the time of the ending of the <hi>prevailing</hi> War of the Beaſt or little Horn againſt the Witneſſes, by a <hi>partial</hi> Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> and a commenſurate Riſing then of the Witneſſes. Which I have demonſtrated as clearly as any thing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in <hi>Euclide.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Medial</hi> Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers cannot poſſibly tell us, nor any one from them <hi>how long</hi> and <hi>no longer</hi> the Churches Afflictions ſhall laſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is better and more expedient for the Church not to know ſo preciſely for a year or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about how long and no longer her afflictions ſhall laſt, leſt upon a lazy confidence that God will then be as good as his word and deliver them, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the fitting themſelves for that deliverance and the proſperity thence enſuing. Which fitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſiſts in an <hi>hearty Holineſs</hi> of life by virtue of <hi>real Regeneration,</hi> in an <hi>inviolable Loyalty</hi> to their Prince, in <hi>prudent</hi> Converſation and <hi>ſincere Benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to all men.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This predicting how long and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (to a year or thereabout) the afflictions of the Church ſhould laſt, is a Priviledge that was not
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:34043:155"/>granted to the <hi>Primitive</hi> Chriſtians themſelves, who yet lay under more grievous Perſecutions, than the Mercy of God is like to permit his Church to ſuffer during the ſpace of the <hi>pouring</hi> out of the <hi>Vials</hi> that is yet to come. And yet they had no more preciſe notice <hi>how long</hi> and <hi>no longer,</hi> than the order of the <hi>ſix Viſions</hi> under the firſt <hi>ſix Seals</hi> could indicate to them. And ſuch an indication have we, and every whit as certain from the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>ſeven Vials.</hi> And when the true Chriſtianity ſhall more generally appear in the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches accompanied with a moſt <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>faſt Loyalty</hi> to their Sovereigns, and ready and <hi>chearful</hi> obedience to all lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands for <hi>Peace, Order</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> in Church and State, this will be an indication of the near approach of the pouring out of the <hi>fourth</hi> Vial on the <hi>Sun,</hi> and of the greateſt Potentates in Chriſtendom their inclining to reform and to ſhake off the ſervile Yoke of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and all the <hi>Idolatrous Trumperies</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging, and of ordering things ſo, that a great <hi>deadneſs</hi> and <hi>darkneſs</hi> will ſeize upon the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and prove the pouring forth of the <hi>fifth</hi> Vial. And the ſixth is manifeſtly touching the <hi>Converſion of the Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> And when the lovely <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian</hi> Spirit ſhall more <hi>univerſally</hi> break forth and ſhine in all the <hi>Enjoyers</hi> of, or <hi>Well-willers</hi> to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> then let them look up and lift up their Heads, for that more <hi>conſummate Redemption</hi> and vaſt enlargement of the <hi>true Church</hi> draweth nigh, and will be atchieved in the Battel of that great Day of God Almighty under the auſpicuous Conduct of that mighty <hi>Heros</hi> on the <hi>white Horſe,</hi> out of whoſe mouth goeth a ſharp Sword, and whoſe Title is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> which is ſharper than any two-edged
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:34043:155"/>Sword, and this is to fall out under the <hi>ſeventh Vial.</hi> And after this is the <hi>deſcent</hi> of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> or Creation of the <hi>New Heaven</hi> and <hi>New Earth,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> ſhall dwell upon the diſſolution of the former Conſtitution of Things, whether <hi>Pagan, Infidel</hi> or <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Polities. Wherefore then ſeeing, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, that all thoſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs, not only <hi>looking for,</hi> but <hi>haſting on</hi> (as the Original has it) the coming of the day of God, even of that <hi>great</hi> day of <hi>God Almighty</hi> in the Battel above-mentioned. But if this Day was fixt to a certain year or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, how could we be ſaid to either haſten it or ſlacken it? But there is no ſuch fixt time ſet, that we be not tempted to <hi>wanton ſecurity</hi> and <hi>lazineſs,</hi> but reminded of our duty, may haſten, as much as in us lies, that great day we expect and deſire by perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God, if we be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and not Hypocrites. But this thing I have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon already. In the mean time it appears <hi>we</hi> have at leaſt as certain indications of the Time of the Churches deliverance as the <hi>Primitive</hi> Chriſtians had before us, in which we are to acquieſce with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and thankfulneſs, and improve them to our beſt advantage to confirm our Faith, and ſupport our Courage.</p>
               <p>And therefore fifthly and laſtly, There being ſo viſible and palpable an order of Revolutions of the Affairs of the World under the <hi>Series</hi> of the <hi>Vials,</hi> whereby the nearer and nearer approach of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate deliverance of the Church of Chriſt and enlargements of his Kingdom may plainly be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it ſeems altogether needleſs that the <hi>Numbers</hi> of

And now in the laſt place to anſwer to what occurs in what I will call your ninth and laſt Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, where you ſay, You cannot but look on thoſe labours as ill beſtowed which tend to obſcure thoſe Prophecies (I ſuppoſe you mean of the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> and that of the <hi>prevailing</hi> War of the <hi>little Horn</hi> againſt the <hi>Saints</hi> for a Time and Times and half a Time) as if we could not by them take any meaſure of the Time of the Churches ſufferings and her deliverance out of them. To this I anſwer, That pains may be faithfully and judiciouſly beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them that remonſtrate to the World, that the Numbers of the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> indicate only a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial deliverance, a thing which I have invincibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated. And I have ſhown even now, that though there be no Prediction (unleſs we recur to the two thouſand three hundred Evening-Mornings, whoſe full <hi>Exitus</hi> is at leaſt four hundred years hence) <hi>how long</hi> and <hi>no longer</hi> to a year or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, till the deliverance of the Church will be fully conſummated and perfected; yet the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Vials,</hi> which reach to a full Victory of the Church and complete deliverance, gives us ſome meaſures to collect the nearer approaches to that happy Time. So that in this caſe to <hi>complain</hi> is to be <hi>unthankful;</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if <hi>we</hi> conſider that <hi>we</hi> are at leaſt as well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for as the <hi>Primitive</hi> Chriſtians were in their
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:34043:156"/>moſt grievous Perſecutions under the red Dragon.</p>
               <p>Wherefore thoſe that would ſqueez out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid <hi>Medial</hi> Prophecies, whether of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> or <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſuch a preciſe determinate time of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches full deliverance, when the nature of thoſe <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial</hi> Numbers and Prophecies will not afford it, what ſhall we ſay of their labour? Is it not in vain? if not worſe. For without good ground to ſet a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe time of the general deliverance of the Church, from a pretended true Interpretation of the Holy Prophecies, when there is really no ſuch thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by them, is to make our ſelves more wiſe and benign than the Divine Spirit the Author of theſe Prophecies, as if he had omitted what was ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for his Church, and is to delude and mock the expectation of God's people, and to ſlur the Holy Prophecies themſelves, and diſcountenance all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of rightly interpreting them. Which has been the Fate of many curious Interpreters, who from the Numbers of the <hi>Medial Viſions,</hi> have preſumed to calculate the <hi>final</hi> Ruine of Antichriſt to a very year. And therefore thoſe that have made it their buſineſs to demonſtrate the groundleſneſs of this Pretence, I hope their labours will prove well beſtowed, nor be <hi>found vain in the Lord,</hi> being earneſtly purſued for <hi>him</hi> and the Honour of <hi>his Word,</hi> who is the <hi>Amen,</hi> the <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>true Witneſs,</hi> and predicts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what will come to paſs, and therefore we muſt not make him predict any thing that will not, either as to <hi>time</hi> or the thing it ſelf.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXX. <hi>Two Arguments out of a</hi> fifth Letter <hi>from the ſame hand to prove, That the</hi> Roman Beaſt <hi>under the</hi> ſeventh Head <hi>was not in being till the</hi> ten Kings <hi>ſignified by the</hi> ten Horns <hi>were riſen up in the Empire. Certain things premiſed in order to an Anſwer to the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. Amongst which is the true Notion of the</hi> Head <hi>of a</hi> Beaſt <hi>in the Prophetick Stile, in</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiſtinction <hi>to his</hi> Horns. <hi>An Enumeration of the Heads of the Beaſt, and what the fulleſt ſenſe of the</hi> ſeventh Head. <hi>An Anſwer to the firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. An Anſwer to the ſecond Argument. Two Arguments of the</hi> Author<hi>'s to prove, that the</hi> Roman Beaſt <hi>under the</hi> ſeventh Head <hi>was in being before the</hi> ten Kings <hi>ſignified by the</hi> ten Horns <hi>were riſen up in the Empire. That the placing the</hi> Epocha <hi>of the forty two months War of the Beaſt in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the</hi> Apoſtaſie <hi>is unexceptionably right, with the groſs abſurdities of the other Opinion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE firſt Argument. If the <hi>Roman Beaſt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> did riſe before the ten Kings in the Empire, then theſe <hi>then Kings</hi> will make an <hi>eighth Head</hi> of themſelves, or at leaſt conjoined with the Emperour as one of their number, when the other nine had poſſeſſed ſo great a part of his Empire, and were as abſolute in their Kingdoms as he in that ſhare was left to him, he having no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence above them but what was merely <hi>Titular</hi> or <hi>Honorary.</hi> Wherefore theſe <hi>together,</hi> and not the Emperours <hi>ſeparately,</hi> ever made the <hi>ſeventh Head</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:34043:157"/>of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> For the ſeven ſorts of ſucceſſive Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours <hi>in Chief</hi> of the Roman Empire as <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,</hi> they <hi>as ſuch</hi> made the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> of the Beaſt, and theſe ten Kings taking in the Greek Emperour, made one Head of the Beaſt as being ſuch. For they ruled as <hi>Chief</hi> in the Empire, and their Government was <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> Wherefore or they are the <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> (nor was the Beaſt revived before its Head) or elſe the Emperours <hi>ſeparately</hi> before was the ſeventh Head; which cannot be. For then the revived Beaſt would have an <hi>eighth</hi> Head, whenas there are <hi>but ſeven</hi> Heads of Blaſphemy according to the Viſions. Therefore the Roman Beaſt under the <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> was not in being till the <hi>ten Kings,</hi> ſignified by the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> were riſen up in the Empire.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument. There being ſeven ſorts of Government, but all agreeing in this, that they are <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> the Sovereignty of the ten Kings ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the whole Empire, every one in his ſhare ought to be deemed the ſeventh Head, it being a <hi>ſeventh ſort</hi> of <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Government; whenas the <hi>Pagano-Chriſtian Caeſars,</hi> though <hi>Idolatrous</hi> indeed as the ſix preceding ſorts of Government were (accounted the firſt ſix Heads of the Beaſt's) would not be properly the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Head of the Beaſt, but the <hi>ſixth</hi> Head again brought into being, as being again <hi>Idolatrous Caeſars</hi> or <hi>Emperours.</hi> Wherefore ſince the Beaſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived to be in being without an Head, nor is ſuppoſed to be again in being according to the Viſions before the ſeventh Head, and the <hi>Pagano-Chriſtian Caeſars</hi> ſeparately being only the <hi>ſixth Head</hi> revived, not a ſeventh, it follows that the aboveſaid ten Kings are the <hi>ſeventh Head,</hi> and that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> under the <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> was not in being till <hi>they</hi> were riſen in the Empire.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:34043:158"/>
               <p>Theſe two Arguments are pretty <hi>preſs</hi> and <hi>cloſe</hi> to the <hi>purpoſe,</hi> and therefore before I go about to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them I will premiſe ſome few things, and ſettle ſome Terms or Notions that occur in the Queſtion and the Prophecies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt therefore, We are to conſider what in the Prophetick Stile is <hi>ſuch</hi> an <hi>Head</hi> of a <hi>Beaſt</hi> as may be ſaid to have <hi>Horns</hi> on it, ſo that there may be ſome <hi>diſtinction</hi> betwixt the <hi>Head</hi> and the <hi>Horn</hi> or <hi>Horns</hi> thereof, and that they may not ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the very ſame thing. Such an Head therefore of a Beaſt as here we are ſearching for, I conceive to be this according to the Prophetick Stile, <hi>viz. Idolatrous Sovereignty in the general abſtractive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and ſucceſſion thereof:</hi> Something like that in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> touching the Woman the Church our Mother, which comprehends the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the Church in a <hi>general</hi> Notion, and yet if you ſpeak of any <hi>particular</hi> perſons of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, though the <hi>whole</hi> be the <hi>Woman</hi> (which whole takes in <hi>all</hi>) yet thoſe particular perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Community are her <hi>Seed</hi> or <hi>Children</hi> according to the Prophetick Stile. But to come yet nearer to the matter; This Notion is plainly ratified by that paſſage in <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 21. where the Kingdom of <hi>Greece</hi> is ſet out by an <hi>He-goat</hi> with a great <hi>Horn</hi> betwixt his eyes, and it is ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 8. that when that great Horn was broken, <hi>four other Horns</hi> roſe after it. Here is plainly a <hi>Beaſt</hi> the <hi>He-goat</hi> with its <hi>Head:</hi> for there is mention of its Eyes and of a Horn on its Head betwixt theſe two Eyes, and of other Horns riſing <hi>ſucceſſively</hi> on this Head, we may be ſure (not on his Back) and yet that great <hi>Horn</hi> is ſaid to be the firſt King: And if
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:34043:158"/>ſo, then the other four Horns muſt be four Kings after him, and yet there is an <hi>Head</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>Horns</hi> plainly in the Viſion. Wherefore what can that Head be but the <hi>Idolatrous Sovereignty</hi> in this <hi>Beaſt</hi> the <hi>Goat</hi> in the general abſtractive comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſucceſſion thereof? And therefore the Kings that <hi>in concreto</hi> are the real Heads of the <hi>Greek</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire are in this <hi>abſtractive Generality</hi> called the <hi>Horns</hi> thereof. And hence it is plain, that the <hi>Idolatrous Sovereignty</hi> in the general abſtractive comprehenſion and ſucceſſion thereof is the <hi>Head,</hi> according to the Prophetick Stile, of which the <hi>ſucceeding Kings</hi> may be ſaid to be the <hi>Horns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The next thing which we will premiſe by way of <hi>Poſtulate</hi> is this. That the revived Beaſt ſet out <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13, and 17. was not revived without an <hi>Head,</hi> there being nothing more abſurd than to imagine a Beaſt to recover out of the ſtate of <hi>Death,</hi> or <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence,</hi> and leave its Head behind it. And it being acknowledged on both ſides, that its Recovery is not till under the <hi>ſeventh Head,</hi> we premiſe alſo that the aboveſaid <hi>Beaſt</hi> did not recover till the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Head,</hi> and that there were <hi>no more Heads</hi> than <hi>ſeven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly therefore, We are to inquire what in truth this <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> of the Beaſt in the full ſenſe thereof is, and in what it differs from the <hi>other ſix,</hi> foraſmuch as <hi>all ſeven</hi> are acknowledged on both ſides to be <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> The <hi>ſeven Idolatrous Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignties</hi> or <hi>Heads</hi> of the Roman Beaſt are theſe, The <hi>Regal,</hi> the <hi>Conſular,</hi> the <hi>Tribuno-Conſular,</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemviral,</hi> the <hi>Dictatorial, Imperatorial,</hi> and <hi>Hieratico-Political</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtico-Secular</hi> Sovereignties or Heads of the Beaſt. Which laſt is moſt <hi>palpably</hi> differenced
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:34043:159"/>and <hi>ſpecifically</hi> from any of the <hi>ſix former,</hi> ſo that this is the very <hi>ſeventh Head.</hi> Which will appear, if we ſeriouſly contemplate the Viſion of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Whore</hi> riding him, <hi>Apoc. Chap.</hi> 17. Here we ſee the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and the <hi>Whore.</hi> By the <hi>Beaſt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is underſtood the Civil part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which muſt alſo have a Civil Head for his Civil Horns to be graſſed upon, which is nothing elſe but <hi>Secular Idolatrous Sovereignty</hi> in the general abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive comprehenſion and ſucceſſion thereof, as was noted above. It is alſo agreed on both ſides, that the <hi>Whore</hi> is the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> or <hi>Hieratical</hi> part of the Empire. But in that this Whore <hi>rides</hi> this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> it is apparent that ſhe <hi>rules</hi> him, and <hi>guides</hi> him, and governs him; as an <hi>Heros</hi> on a <hi>Pharos</hi> or goodly Steed is the very <hi>Symbol</hi> of an <hi>Emperour.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is plainly in the Viſion <hi>two</hi> Sovereignties <hi>Hieratical</hi> or Sacerdotal, and <hi>Political</hi> or Civil, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly deſcribed, and both ſuppoſed <hi>Idolatrous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now for their <hi>Coaleſcency</hi> into one ſeventh So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, that is as apparent as the other in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For the <hi>Whore</hi> having the guidance of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Head of the Beaſt, has the <hi>guidance</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and his <hi>Horns</hi> as they come up, come they up as faſt or ſlowly as they will. Wherefore the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Horns</hi> being at the <hi>guidance</hi> or governance of the <hi>Whore,</hi> and both aiming at the ſame end, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing or maintaining the <hi>Idolatrous</hi> State of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire (for <hi>that</hi> is that which the Viſion drives at, not <hi>Secular</hi> affairs) they do evidently conſtitute this <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex Sovereignty</hi> (to which there is nothing like in all the ſix foregoing Sovereignties) which I call <hi>Hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico-Political</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtico-Secular,</hi> the Eccleſiaſtick and Secular Sovereignty complying together to make
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34043:159"/>the <hi>Empire</hi> a <hi>Beaſt</hi> again, that is, <hi>bloody</hi> and <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous.</hi> So that whereas in my <hi>former Anſwers</hi> I was at a loſs in a manner to define, whether the <hi>Hierati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Sovereignty or <hi>Secular</hi> was the Head of the Beaſt, here I have fairly and ſolidly, I hope, compounded the matter by making them both but one <hi>Hieratico-Political</hi> Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> revived <hi>Beaſt</hi> or <hi>Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Empire.</hi> With which, as I have noted in my former <hi>Anſwers,</hi> that paſſage in <hi>Daniel</hi> excellently well agrees that ſeems to make the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> in the time of the <hi>ten Toes</hi> of the <hi>Metalline Image,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> than <hi>Secular, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 41. The Kingdom ſhall be divided, but there ſhall be in it <hi>of the ſtrength of Iron,</hi> foraſmuch as thou ſaweſt the <hi>Iron mixed</hi> with the <hi>miry Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> There ſhall be of the <hi>ſtrength of the Iron</hi> in this Kingdom; as if that was but <hi>acceſſory</hi> to it, but the <hi>Kingdom it ſelf. Clay,</hi> i. e. <hi>Sacerdotal.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Iron</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>mixt</hi> with the <hi>miry Clay,</hi> as if the <hi>Clay</hi> (which is the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal Sovereignty</hi> or Empire) were the <hi>Principal</hi> again, the <hi>Iron acceſſory.</hi> As when the greater ſhare is of water in the Cup we ſay there is <hi>Wine mingled</hi> with the <hi>Water;</hi> but if the greater ſhare be <hi>Wine,</hi> we ſay <hi>Water is mingled</hi> with the <hi>Wine.</hi> And out of this <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Empire, how naturally does the <hi>Pope</hi> riſe at laſt quite to over-top all, and how eaſily is the <hi>Papal Hierarchy</hi> conceived to be the <hi>little Horn</hi> ariſing properly out of the <hi>Hieratical part</hi> of this Complex Sovereignty of the Empire?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly and laſtly, We will take notice of the genuine meaning of thoſe words, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.12. <hi>That the ten Kings receive power as Kings one hour with the Beaſt;</hi> whoſe natural and unforced ſenſe is this, That at what time the Empire began to be a
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34043:160"/>Beaſt, and to Apoſtatize into groſs Superſtitions and Idolatry, the ten Kings would be catching at and obtaining Kingdoms, ſome here, ſome there, ſome ſooner, ſome later till about the four hundred and fifty ſixth year after Chriſt they had all ſped. For that this one hour does ſignifie a pretty latitude of time all Interpreters conſent, and Hiſtory witneſſes that it was at leaſt forty years till there appeared ten Kingdoms in the divided Empire. And therefore if the <hi>Beaſt</hi> be not till the <hi>tenth</hi> King appear, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to receive Kingdoms <hi>with the Beaſt</hi> but <hi>before him.</hi> Which is plainly to contradict the Text of the Prophecy. Theſe things being premiſed, we anſwer,</p>
               <p>To the firſt Argument, (1.) That what is here preſumed is not proved, nor will prove true, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Emperours had no more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty over the other Kings than what was mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Titular</hi> or <hi>Honorary.</hi> For it is well known that <hi>thoſe Kings</hi> ſubmitted to the Laws of the <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> which <hi>Juſtinian</hi> cauſed to be collected, not for the uſe of his <hi>ſhare only</hi> of the Empire, but for the uſe of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> at <hi>large,</hi> inſomuch that ſome phanſie that to be the reviving of the Roman Beaſt again, or making his Image. (2.) Hiſtory cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, that is, the <hi>Emperours</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and Prophecy being but An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipatory Hiſtory, and the Emperours of an Empire being the <hi>Heads</hi> thereof, it is wonderfully eaſie and natural to imagine the <hi>Pagano-Chriſtian Caeſars</hi> to be the ſeventh Head of the Beaſt, till the <hi>Pope</hi> play'd the <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf, and perked up above them. (3.) The ſecular Head of the Beaſt upon which the Horns grow, is of a more general and abſtracted nature,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:34043:160"/>than to be confined either to the Idolatrous or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gano-Chriſtian Emperours ſeparately, or to the ten Kings taking the Emperour in for one. It is only a Pagano-Chriſtian or Idolatrous <hi>Secular</hi> Sovereignty in the general abſtractive comprehenſion and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof, which is the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Head of this revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Beaſt; as the <hi>He-goats</hi> head in <hi>Daniel,</hi> which takes in the <hi>great Horn,</hi> but one, and the <hi>four Horns</hi> after, with their ſucceſſions, and this all but <hi>one</hi> Goats Head, and therefore the Idolatrous or Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no-Chriſtian Emperours <hi>ſeparately,</hi> and after taken in as one of the ten Kings, all this makes but <hi>one ſeventh</hi> ſecular Idolatrous Sovereignty or ſeventh ſecular Head of the Beaſt, as may appear out of the firſt and third Premiſſes. (4.) And laſtly therefore, The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours <hi>ſeparately</hi> firſt, and then in Conjunction with the Kings to make them ten, being but <hi>one continued Idolatrous</hi> or Pagano Chriſtian <hi>Sovereignty</hi> (which is all the Viſion aims at) and ſo but one <hi>Head</hi> of the Beaſt, it is manifeſt that an <hi>eighth</hi> Head is ſhut out of doors, and the force of the firſt Argument plainly enervated; And that therefore for all this, the Beaſt was in being before the Kings were riſen, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences as high as the Re-paganizing <hi>Caeſars</hi> and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie of the Empire. Which is alſo confirmed from the fourth or laſt Premiſs.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond Argument we anſwer, (1.) That the Pagano-Chriſtian <hi>Caeſars</hi> or Emperours, though they be Idolatrous and Emperours, yet it does not follow that they are <hi>only</hi> the <hi>ſixth</hi> Head (which was Idolatrous Emperours) re-introduced on the Stage, not a <hi>ſeventh.</hi> For theſe <hi>Pagano-Chriſtian</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, though they be <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> yet they are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably Chriſtian</hi> in their way, they profeſſing the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34043:161"/>
                  <hi>true Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and therefore are rightly deemed a diſtinct Head of the Empire as well as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (the other not yet come) is accounted a diſtinct <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Head</hi> of the Empire for being <hi>purely</hi> Chriſtian. He is according to the Declaration of the Angel the <hi>ſeventh King</hi> or <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> though not of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the Empire then ceaſing to be a Beaſt in his Reign. Wherefore if Chriſtianity did conſtitute the <hi>purely</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Caeſars</hi> or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours a <hi>ſeventh</hi> Head of the Empire diſtinct from the <hi>ſixth</hi> Head (the Idolatrous Emperours Pagan) du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Time the Empire ceaſed to be a Beaſt, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Pagano-Chriſtianity</hi> or Idolatry mixt with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in the <hi>Caeſars</hi> and <hi>Empire</hi> will make the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gano-Chriſtian Caeſars</hi> or Emperours, the <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in them, a Head diſtinct from the ſixth Head the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Idolatrous Caeſars;</hi> and the <hi>Idolatry</hi> in them will make them, <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Head of the Empire</hi> ceaſing to be a Beaſt (as it did under the Reign of the <hi>purely</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Caeſars</hi>) but the Head of the Empire grown a <hi>Beaſt</hi> again by its <hi>Apoſtatized</hi> condition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And thus the <hi>Pagano-Chriſtian Caeſars</hi> will prove plainly the next Succeſſours to the ſixth Head of the <hi>Roman Beaſt,</hi> though not of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and therefore will conſequently be part at leaſt of the <hi>ſucceſſive Sovereignty,</hi> that is, the <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> (2.) But in the ſecond place I anſwer, That the <hi>real, full</hi> and complete <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> is that <hi>Hieratico-Political</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty deſcribed in the third Premiſs: nor do I doubt but that it is the moſt full and perfect Notion of the <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> And this <hi>Hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico-Political</hi> Sovereignty commenced as early as the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> of the Empire, as may be made out from
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:34043:161"/>my Anſwers which declare the <hi>early</hi> complying of the <hi>Emperours</hi> with the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> of the Empire into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganick Superſtitions and Idolatries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whence it plainly follows, that to reſtrain the <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> to the time of the <hi>ten Kings</hi> riſen in the Empire, upon pretence that there was no <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>ſixth</hi> till then, is to conclude a thing upon no ſufficient grounds. For at the very firſt ſight this <hi>Hieratico-Political</hi> Head is manifeſtly a ſort or <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of <hi>Head</hi> diſtinct not only from the <hi>ſixth</hi> Head of the Beaſt, but alſo from all the five foregoing Heads in the very Conſtitution thereof. The thing is ſo plain of it ſelf, that there wants no inſiſting upon it. Conſider but the third Premiſs, and the thing will be abundantly clear.</p>
               <p>Thus are theſe two Arguments for the proving that the Roman Beaſt under the ſeventh Head was not in being till the ten Kings, ſignified by the ten Horns, were riſen up in the Empire, utterly defeated. I ſhall hint only now two brief Arguments againſt the Concluſion the other two would infer, to prove the contradictory thereto, and ſo conclude; that is to ſay, to prove, That the <hi>Roman Beaſt</hi> under the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Head</hi> was in being before the <hi>ten Kings</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the <hi>ten Horns</hi> were riſen up in the Empire.</p>
               <p n="1">1. My firſt Argument ſhall be grounded on the fourth or laſt Premiſs, which is the genuine ſenſe of <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.12. The ten Kings receive power as Kings one hour with the Beaſt. Of which the eaſie and natural ſenſe is, That at what time the Empire grows into that ſtate of Apoſtaſie, <hi>viz.</hi> into Paganiſh Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Idolatry, that according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Stile, it may be called a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> at that very time will the barbarous Commanders that invade the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:34043:162"/>Roman Empire be catching at and obtaining King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, ſome here, ſome there, ſome ſooner, ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a matter of forty or fifty years together at leaſt, till all ten appear upon the Stage. Wherefore if the <hi>Beaſt</hi> be not under the <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> till then, the <hi>ten Kings,</hi> at leaſt <hi>nine</hi> of them, will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Kingdoms with the Beaſt, but before the Beaſt is, which is point-blank againſt the words of the Prophecy. Wherefore this alone may demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, That the <hi>Beaſt</hi> was in <hi>being</hi> under the <hi>ſeventh Head,</hi> unleſs you will make an headleſs Beaſt of him (which ſhall be my ſecond Argument) before the ten Horns, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ten Kings roſe up in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other Argument is taken from the ſecond Premiſs. So ſoon as the Empire apoſtatized into Paganiſh Superſtition and Idolatry, the <hi>Empire</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>Beast,</hi> according to the Prophetick Stile, and as ſoon as it was a <hi>Beast</hi> again it had an <hi>head,</hi> and that very <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> exhibited in the Prophetick Viſions, by Premiſs the ſecond. But this State com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced at leaſt fifty years before the ten Horns, that is, the ten Kings were all riſen up in the Empire. Wherefore the <hi>Beast</hi> under the <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> was in being before the ten Kings or ten Horns were riſen up in the Empire. Which was the thing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, and which I conceive can never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, nor ſolidly anſwered by any one that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> began at leaſt fifty years before the ten Kings appeared in the Roman Empire. In the interval indeed betwixt the <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gano-Chriſtian Caeſars</hi> there was <hi>no Head</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> but that was the time wherein there was <hi>no Beaſt.</hi> It was that time in which that part of the Name of the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:34043:162"/>Beaſt was made good, <hi>viz.</hi> [Is not] (was and is not) as that part is made good under the <hi>Pagano Chriſtian Caeſars,</hi> or at large under the <hi>ſeventh Head, viz.</hi> [Is not and yet is]. For then it is rightly ſaid of him, He <hi>is not</hi> that <hi>old Pagan</hi> Beaſt; and yet being again then <hi>revived</hi> into the <hi>Image</hi> of the former Pagan Beaſt in this Pagano-Chriſtianity, it is rightly ſaid of him that <hi>he is,</hi> and ſo the whole is fulfilled, [Is not and yet is]. But certainly when-ever he was, either in his primitive or revived ſtate, he was not without an Head by Premiſs the ſecond.</p>
               <p>And thus we have ſeen how ſolid and unexceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable their Opinion is, that place the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the forty two months War of the Beaſt with the Saints or Witneſſes as high as the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> of the Empire into Paganiſh Superſtition and Idolatry, that is to ſay, about three hundred ninety three or four hundred years after Chriſt. According to which <hi>Epocha</hi> the Reformation begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> which is the <hi>partial</hi> Fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the then commenſurate <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> will commence about the middle of the ſecond month of the laſt <hi>Hexamenon</hi> or <hi>Semi-time,</hi> and reach into the middle of the fifth, if not into the ſixth month, which is a wonderful, eaſie, natural and congruous completion of the time of the Event of that Viſion. But if the <hi>Epocha</hi> of that forty two months War be placed fifty or ſixty years later, <hi>viz.</hi> at the Riſing up of the tenth King or tenth Horn in the Roman Empire, the Riſing of the Witneſſes will begin about twenty years before the laſt Semi-time, which is harſh and incongruous. Beſides that it would not reach the end this <hi>Epocha</hi> is intended for: <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew there will be a further fulfilling of this Viſion of the Riſing of the Witneſſes even to a <hi>full</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:34043:163"/>ruine of the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> or the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> ſo that the deliverance of the Church will be fully completed before the Expiration of the forty two months. Which is plainly repugnant to expreſs indications in the Viſion it ſelf.</p>
               <p>For firſt, The <hi>partial</hi> Fall or Fall of the <hi>tenth part</hi> of the City is plainly ſaid to come to paſs after the three days and an half, which is the ſame with a Time and Times and half a Time or forty two months. So that it is as evident as if it were writ with a beam of the Sun, that the <hi>final</hi> iſſue of the forty two months War of the Beaſt with the Saints or Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is no other than the <hi>partial</hi> Fall or Fall of the <hi>tenth part</hi> of the City, and not of the whole City, and a Riſing then of the Witneſſes commenſurate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>And then in the ſecond place, If the completion of this Viſion of the Fall of the City and Riſing of the Witneſſes were (within the forty two months ſpace) extended to a full deliverance of the true Church and an utter Ruine of <hi>Babylon</hi> or the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> ſince the fulfilling of this Viſion of the Riſing of the Witneſſes is before the <hi>Exitus</hi> of the <hi>ſixth</hi> Trumpet, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.14. and that it is confeſſed on both ſides that the <hi>Vials</hi> all of them follow the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> and are in the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> and that yet theſe Vials are to be poured upon the Beaſt; by this reckoning there will be no <hi>Beaſt</hi> left for them to be poured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which is a moſt manifeſt Repugnancy.</p>

               <p>The entire <hi>Area</hi> of the whole Temple, on which it is built, <hi>viz.</hi> a. b. c. d. is five hundred Cubits long, and as many broad, and therefore is a perfect Square. A perpetual <hi>Porticus,</hi> noted with three Lines, of which the middle is <hi>punctulated</hi> or made by points, fifty Cubits broad divides this whole <hi>Area</hi> into ſeven equal ſquare <hi>Area's</hi> SW. NW. X. Y. SE. Z. NE and into one oblong <hi>Area,</hi> α. β. γ. δ. having the length of two hundred and fifty Cubits, but the breadth of an hundred Cubits. And there is a perpetual mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Ambulation or Walk in this perpetual <hi>Porticus;</hi>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:34043:164"/>And the middle Line, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is <hi>punctulated</hi> drawn through the midſt of this Walk, doth fitly and that perpetually divide the <hi>Porticus,</hi> in reſpect of the ſaid <hi>Area's</hi> into <hi>exteriour</hi> and <hi>interiour.</hi> Which being done, it will be manifeſt that the oblong <hi>Area</hi> with the interiour <hi>Porticus</hi> lying about it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to it, <hi>viz.</hi> ε. ξ. η. θ. will bear preciſely a double proportion to each of the ſeven <hi>Area's</hi> with their interiour <hi>Porticus's</hi> belonging to them, and looking into them ſingle, as in ε. ι. χ. λ. and ſo of the reſt. For the interiour <hi>Porticus's</hi> look into their own proper <hi>Area's</hi> or Courts, the <hi>exteriour</hi> into their neighbouring Courts or <hi>Area's,</hi> excepting the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all, as μ. ι. ρ. ν. and the reſt which are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the Perimeter. For theſe look out into the fields. But from hence we may underſtand how na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally all the <hi>Porticus's</hi> which have Courts and <hi>Area's</hi> placed on both ſides, as σ. α. γ. ν. and φ. χ. ψ. ω. are divided long-wiſe into two equal parts, and that thoſe parts only which look into the next <hi>Area,</hi> are to be reckoned to be the <hi>Porticus</hi> of that <hi>Area.</hi> And therefore whenas that long <hi>Porticus</hi> which on all ſides compaſſeth the reſt of the ſpace of the Temple, can be rightly thought to look into a neighbouring <hi>Area</hi> only by one half of it ſelf divided long-wiſe, it is very reaſonable that that <hi>interiour</hi> half part only of the <hi>Porticus</hi> ſhould be every where aſſigned to its adjacent <hi>Area.</hi> Whence ſeven <hi>Area's</hi> with their <hi>interiour Porticus's</hi> that encompaſs them (for the exteriour belong not to them) will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly equal. And all the <hi>ſeven</hi> ſingle <hi>Area's</hi> entire, conſiſting of themſelves, and of the addition of the Spaces of the <hi>interiour Porticus's</hi> that encompaſs them, will have a ſub-double proportion to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:34043:165"/>
                  <hi>Area</hi> mentioned above, and conſiſting of it ſelf and the ſpace of the <hi>Porticus's</hi> twenty five Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits broad, and encompaſſing it. Whence the entire <hi>Area's</hi> of the ſeven Courts with their <hi>Porticus's</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned thereto, will be to the entire oblong <hi>Area</hi> with its <hi>Porticus's</hi> alſo taken in to the Reckoning, as <hi>ſeven</hi> is to <hi>two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly this, as it is ſufficiently congruous and handſom in it ſelf, ſo it may have ſome further uſe not at all to be contemned. For whereas <hi>Villalpandus</hi> will have in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple a certain Court of the Gentiles, exteriour to the Court which is termed <hi>Atrium Iſraelis,</hi> why may not the <hi>exteriour</hi> part of this <hi>Porticus</hi> which is adjacent to the whole <hi>Perimeter</hi> of the Temple be accounted for part of the Court of the Gentiles, and be encompaſſed with a Wall (of which there is mention <hi>Ezek. Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 5.) a Reed broad and a Reed high, although at what diſtance it is from this <hi>Porticus,</hi> there is no certainty at all. For if what occurs <hi>Chap.</hi> 42. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, &amp;c. in the Hebrew Text is to be retained, that meaſuring by Reeds is to be myſtically underſtood which prefigures a large extent of the Church of the Gentiles in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the Jewiſh Church. But that there was ſome other Wall without, or at leaſt one repreſented to the Prophet by way of Type, ſeems very probable, and that the <hi>exteriour</hi> part of the <hi>Perimetral Porticus</hi> has a reference thereto. For this deſcription of the Temple is a <hi>Prophetical</hi> Viſion, and exhibited for the uſe of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> which was to come.</p>
               <p>In the mean time it is plain out of what has been ſaid, that this is one way from whence we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the proportion <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of the Outer Court to the Inner, that is, of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:34043:165"/>Court SW. X. SE. Z. NE. Y. NW. to ε. ξ. η. θ. is as 7. to 2. or <hi>Ratio iripla ſeſquialtera.</hi> But there is yet another Method leſs operoſe, nor haply leſs true for all that, to be underſtood from what has been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; namely, if letting go the <hi>Porticus's</hi> we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare only the Nine ſquare <hi>Area's</hi> each an hundred Cubits long, and as many broad, of which ſeven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Atrium Iſraelis</hi> or the <hi>Outer</hi> Court, the other two are found in the Court of the Temple and Prieſts. For thoſe ſeven in the <hi>Atrium Iſraelis,</hi> viz. SW. X. SE. Z NE. Y. NW. have to the other two α. β. ν. ξ. and ο. π. υ. δ. <hi>Rationem triplam ſeſquialteram,</hi> the proportion of three and an half to one.

               <p>But now this ſecond way ſeems to me to be moſt expedite, if it may be fitly applied to the Text. Let us therefore try what will become of it, <hi>Apoc. Chap.</hi> 11. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But let us hear <hi>Villalpandus</hi> himſelf deſcant upon this laſt Verſe: This meaſure, ſays he, is duly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as being that which ſeems moſt neceſſary for fully conceiving the meaſures of the Courts or of the general <hi>Ichnography</hi> of the Temple. For here, ſays he, a certain Occidental <hi>Area</hi> of the Temple is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, having the length and breadth of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cubits, which hitherto the Angel had not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured. Which <hi>Area</hi> equal to the others, and of the like poſiture with the others, which had been mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in the beginning, plainly ſhows both that the whole entire <hi>Area</hi> of the Temple was ſquare, and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:34043:168"/>that <hi>Porticus's</hi> likewiſe ran thorough the whole Ground-plot of the Temple, and divided it into nine equal ſquare <hi>Area's,</hi> as you ſee in the <hi>Ichnogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>It is evident from the places quoted, that there are five equal ſquare <hi>Area's</hi> with their <hi>Porticus's</hi> diſpoſed into the form of a <hi>Croſs.</hi> But now it is plain out of <hi>Ezekiel, Chap.</hi> 46. <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22. where he ſpeaks of the Courts for boiling and baking, that there is a ſquare <hi>Area</hi> encompaſſed with like <hi>Porticus's</hi> over againſt the <hi>fifth</hi> ſquare <hi>Area</hi> upon a great part of which the Temple ſtands; foraſmuch as there are four <hi>Atriola</hi> or <hi>little</hi> Courts in every corner of that exteriour Court ſo placed, as was ſaid. And there is the ſame Reaſon of the other three Courts which anſwer to this in ſituation, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are three other ſuch Courts encompaſſed with like <hi>Porticus's</hi> toward the South-Weſt quarter, South-Eaſt quarter and North-Eaſt quarter, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe noted with SW.

                  </gap> or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at large to be very maimed and deformed. And what has hitherto been ſaid proves the ſpace on which the Temple with its Courts and <hi>Porticus's</hi> is placed, not only to be <hi>ſquare,</hi> but to be divided into nine ſquare <hi>Area's</hi> encompaſſed with their reſpective <hi>Porticus's,</hi> all of them quite round, ſave the <hi>fifth,</hi> and the next lying full Eaſt of it: theſe two have <hi>Porticus's</hi> only on three ſides.</p>
               <p>But that the ſquareneſs of this whole Space on which the Temple ſtands, is rightly gathered by <hi>Villalpandus,</hi> may further appear from <hi>Ezek. Chap.</hi> 42. <hi>v.</hi> 15. Now when he had made an end of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the <hi>inner</hi> Houſe, he brought me forth toward
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:34043:169"/>the Gate, whoſe Proſpect is toward the Eaſt, and meaſured it (<hi>viz.</hi> the Houſe) round about. When he had finiſhed the Meaſures of the inner Houſe, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And yet there is ſtill a pretty odd confirmation of the matter behind, which I conceive is worth the noting. It is indeed a Paganick Oracle, and ſuch as
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:34043:171"/>implies the Pagan Daemon to have ſuppoſed or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known the proportion of the <hi>outer</hi> Court to the <hi>inner</hi> according to theſe Dimenſions of <hi>Villalpandus.</hi> The thing is recorded in S. <hi>Auguſtine, De Civitate Dei, lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cap. penult. &amp; ult.</hi> In the year of our Lord 313. the Gentiles were informed by the Oracles of their Daemons, that <hi>Peter,</hi> forſooth, had ſo bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the World, that the Name of Chriſt ſhould be worſhipped for three hundred ſixty five years, but after the ſaid number of years being completed, forthwith there would be an end, <hi>viz.</hi> of this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt. And to this Oracle, ſays the Father, the Gentiles gave ſuch great credit, that they were called back from the Chriſtian Profeſſion, nor would embrace it till the end of the ſaid years, after they had found the Oracle to be falſe. Now that the Oracles of the Daemons ſhould circumſcribe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Worſhip of Chriſt within three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixty five years, verily it is hugely difficult to divine whence they drew that Conjecture, unleſs from that Apocalyptick Viſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. (where <hi>John</hi> is commanded to meaſure the Temple and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, but for the <hi>outer</hi> Court to caſt it out to be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot by the Gentiles for forty two months) compared with the Courts of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, whoſe dimenſions, by reaſon of their great Longevity, they very well knew and diſcerned the <hi>outer</hi> Court to have to the inner <hi>Rationem triplam ſeſquialteram,</hi> the proportion of three and an half to one. From whence they eaſily collected the <hi>outer</hi> Court being to the <hi>inner</hi> as the Conculcation of the Gentiles for forty two months to the Worſhip of the Name of Chriſt, that the Worſhip of Chriſt was to continue but twelve Prophetick months, or three hundred and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:34043:171"/>ſixty years. For as ſeven is to two, ſo forty two to twelve. But for greater Caution they added five years, which might anſwer to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the five adjectitious days in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> year. So careful, forſooth, was the Devil in framing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, leſt his Clients might over-haſtily expect the Event, and ſo himſelf ſeem to have been deceived. And being he was ſo careful of not ſeeming to be deceived, it's a ſign he would not have given out this Oracular Compute, unleſs he had been ſure of the proportion of the <hi>outer</hi> Court to the <hi>inner:</hi> which is a notable confirmation of <hi>Villalpandus</hi>'s dimenſions of the ſaid Courts of the Temple. But as cunning as he was, the Devil was egregiouſly deceived in this, that he thought the Worſhip of Chriſt would ceaſe at the end of thoſe years, whenas the Viſion only intimates that his Worſhip after three hundred and ſixty years would be contaminated with the <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous</hi> Rites and <hi>Superſtitions</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but not that pure <hi>Paganiſm</hi> ſhould ever return again.</p>
               <p>Some haply may be ready to laugh at this Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical skill in the Devils, of meaſuring the Courts of the Temple, whereas in the mean time they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are more to be laught at for their own unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or ignorance in Hiſtory, which informs us, that the Oracle told the Inhabitants of <hi>Delos,</hi>

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:34043:172"/>For it is not the work of a bad or dull-ſighted Wit, but of one extremely well exerciſed in the skill of Lines, to find or take two middle Proportionals.

               <p>THESE four Queſtions upon occaſion of ſome Papers from one not unverſed in <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Speculations, I think fit to conſider and to anſwer touching the Viſion contained in the fourth and fifth Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> (1.)

Who are that Company that are aſſiſtent or about the Throne. (4.) Who is that Lamb ſlain to whom the Book is given. I ſhall firſt ſet down the Opinion of thoſe Papers orderly one after another, and then give my own Judgment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I affirm, ſays the Author of thoſe Papers, that by <hi>opening</hi> this Book of Prophecies is meant <hi>explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it and making it intelligible to thoſe that read it. For the truth of this Propoſition I appeal to the conſtant and unqueſtionable uſe of that Phraſe of <hi>opening</hi> a <hi>ſealed</hi> Prophecy where-ever it is uſed throughout the Scripture, there being no one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that I know of, to the contrary.

S. <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid to have opened and alledged (<hi>viz.</hi> out of the Prophecies of the Scripture) that Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered. Whence it cannot be doubted (as to me it ſeems) but that by <hi>opening</hi> the <hi>ſealed Book,</hi> or Myſtery, is meant <hi>explaining</hi> it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This makes a pretty confident ſhow, and may impoſe upon the heedleſs. But the wary will eaſily perceive, that unleſs he could prove that the word <hi>Opening</hi> ſimply in it ſelf ſignified <hi>Explaining;</hi> and <hi>ſealing, hiding</hi> the ſenſe of a Writing by <hi>myſtical Aenigms,</hi> the Argument proves nothing. That ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Phraſe of <hi>opening</hi> a <hi>Bible</hi> and <hi>opening</hi> a <hi>Text</hi> ſhows plainly, the word Opening has its determinate ſenſe from the thing it is ſpoken of. To <hi>open</hi> the <hi>Bible</hi> is to <hi>unclaſpe</hi> it, and ſo <hi>open</hi> the <hi>Book,</hi> that we may come at the <hi>Text.</hi> To <hi>open</hi> the <hi>Text</hi> is to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain</hi> the ſenſe of it. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies to explain Myſteries, or to open Myſteries ſometimes; but <hi>Luke</hi> 4.17. it ſignifies only to open the Book where the Myſteries lye, <hi>viz.</hi> the Book of <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet which paſt into the hand of Chriſt, he is ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to <hi>open</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> and to find the place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is one thing therefore to <hi>open</hi> a <hi>ſealed Book</hi> where the <hi>Prophecy</hi> is, and another to open a <hi>ſealed Prophecy.</hi> The <hi>Book</hi> may be firſt <hi>opened</hi> to <hi>come at</hi> the <hi>Prophecy.</hi> Which is plainly the caſe here of the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:34043:173"/>
                  <hi>ſeven-ſealed</hi> Book. But to make the <hi>opening</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> and <hi>looſing</hi> the <hi>Seals</hi> to be the <hi>explaining</hi> the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.2. is a plain contradiction to the very Text, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. where the <hi>opening</hi> the <hi>firſt ſix Seals</hi> is the <hi>exhibiting</hi> to <hi>John</hi> ſo many particular <hi>Prophetical Viſions</hi> of things to come, not the <hi>explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> thoſe Viſions. And ſo the <hi>opening</hi> the <hi>ſeventh Seal</hi> is the <hi>exhibiting</hi> the Viſions of the <hi>ſeven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. and not the <hi>explaining</hi> of them. So that I wonder it ſhould ever, againſt ſo palpable an intimation to the contrary, enter into any mans mind that the <hi>opening</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> and <hi>looſing</hi> the <hi>Seals</hi> ſhould be underſtood of <hi>explaining</hi> the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and not of a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>coming at the Prophecies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> ſet out in Aenigmatical Viſions, and to be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>explained</hi> by the Servants of Chriſt, and the meaning of the <hi>Aenigmata</hi> diſcovered. But to make this latter to be underſtood as a <hi>Completion</hi> of this Viſion of the opening of the Seals, is a plain repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy to the Viſions Interpretation of it ſelf. The <hi>Completion</hi> of this part of the Viſion of <hi>opening the Seals,</hi> is our having theſe <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Viſions in our hands and under our eyes, no other <hi>Completion</hi> is to be dreamt of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Touching the ſecond Queſtion the aboveſaid Papers declare thus, That by him that ſitteth on the Throne with the Book in his right hand is <hi>not</hi> meant <hi>God himſelf,</hi> but rather ſome <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>higheſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> ſitting in the Throne of God, and repreſenting him there. A reverend and learned Doctor phanſies him to be the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Author of the Papers to be ſome earthly King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this to me ſeems point-blank againſt the Text, nor has <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf the confidence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:34043:174"/>it of any other than of <hi>God Almighty,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that Hymn, I ſuppoſe, or Doxology, <hi>v.</hi> 8. Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. This Hymn is ſung to him that ſits on the Throne the <hi>Eternal,</hi> who is ſaid to live for ever and ever, <hi>v.</hi> 9. Now as this is but one ſingle viſionary Hymn, ſo no man can have any juſt ground to imagine any more than one viſionary Perſon on the Throne, there is not the leaſt ſhow or ſhadow in the Viſion of any more. Whence comparing this Hymn with that <hi>ſingle</hi> Perſon, it muſt of neceſſity be <hi>God Almighty</hi> himſelf, no earthly Potentate Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of Him. Nor is the Hymn fit to be ſung to a Repreſentative (though of God) ſitting on the Throne. For if to Him, he is the <hi>Object</hi> of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xology, and the Text ſays expreſly, it is <hi>to him</hi> that <hi>ſits on the Throne.</hi> And therefore it muſt be <hi>to God himſelf</hi> that ſits on the Throne, unleſs we will make this a viſionary Scene of <hi>palpable Idolatry,</hi> which I take to be a groſs abſurdity. Beſides that, as for earthly Potentates, Kings or Monarchs, they are moſt lively deſcribed in the twenty four <hi>crowned</hi> Elders, like ſo many <hi>Millennial Davids,</hi> playing on their Harps before God. The Rain-bow alſo plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates it, as in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> to be the Repreſentation of the <hi>glory of the God of Iſrael.</hi> So that I find no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity or probability in this Opinion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now for the third Queſtion, the words of the Paper are theſe. I affirm, ſaith he, that the fourth and fifth Chapters of the Revelation are a deſcription of a Church, or a Company of faithful people on Earth; adding, This is ſo evident, that I know of no man that denies it. This therefore he takes for granted without any further proof.</p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:34043:174"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here I refer the Reader to what I have wrote in the twenty firſt Chapter of this Book tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſion to the <hi>ſealed Book</hi>-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. Where, though it be an <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſion; and a <hi>Symbol</hi> of the <hi>ſpiritual Kingdom of God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> yet I acknowledge that it is in ſome things ſo attemperated, that it is ſignificative alſo of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> on Earth; as that ſuppoſe of the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium.</hi> And that the Church on Earth is ſome way and in ſome things concerned in this Viſion, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 10. And haſt made us Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reign on the Earth. But this will not ſerve the end of theſe Papers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, for the fourth Queſtion, By the <hi>Lamb ſlain,</hi> according to thoſe Papers, ſome good King or other (ſome myſtical Chriſt, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> calls <hi>Conſtantine</hi> upon <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.5.) is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, who after his having ſuffered like a Lamb, was to be again advanced to the Throne of God. Some ſuch ſenſe, quoth he, as this we ſhall be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to put upon it; foraſmuch as it exceeds all belief to think that when the Book aforeſaid ſhall be to be <hi>opened,</hi> God himſelf in Perſon ſhall appear amongſt us ſitting on a Throne with a <hi>Book</hi> in his <hi>right hand,</hi> and that after <hi>Proclamation made</hi> for one to <hi>open it,</hi> in the Ears of all the World, his Son Jeſus ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear coming to his Father, and take it out of his hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or which is equally abſurd, the four Beaſts and twenty four Elders ſhall be taken up into Heaven to ſee the ſame things acted there. Whence it is concluded, That the <hi>ſealed Book</hi> is not to be opened by the <hi>Lamb himſelf</hi> in perſon, but by <hi>ſome</hi> mortal man or other <hi>whom</hi> he ſhall imploy in this ſervice.</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:34043:175"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is argued handſomly enough, were it not upon a double falſe Foundation: The firſt is, That <hi>opening</hi> the <hi>Seals</hi> is <hi>explaining</hi> the Prophecies, which I have already ſhown to be a miſtake. The other is, That this Viſion is an <hi>abſolute Viſion,</hi> not an <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſion to the <hi>Book-Prophecy,</hi> which point I have cleared <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. nor need I here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat things. And in the third and laſt place. The <hi>individual Perſon</hi> of Chriſt is ſo <hi>exquiſitely deſcribed,</hi> that no other but himſelf can be meant. For beſides that he is ſaid to be <hi>ſlain,</hi> and to have <hi>redeemed</hi> us with his <hi>Blood,</hi> and to have made us Kings and Prieſts, he is ſtiled the <hi>Lion of the Tribe of Judah,</hi> and the <hi>Root of David.</hi> How is it poſſible that any one but Chriſt himſelf can be meant by this deſcription? This is no deſcription of a <hi>myſtical</hi> Chriſt, but of the <hi>very Perſon</hi> of Chriſt himſelf. I am thus brief in anſwering this laſt Queſtion, becauſe there will be an abundant ſupplement made in the anſwering the <hi>Confutatory</hi> part of his Papers, where he endeavours to entangle my Hypotheſis with as many difficulties as he can. Wherefore I will in the next Chapter give a ſummary Account of my ſenſe of this Viſion, and then anſwer to his Allegations againſt it.</p>

               <p>COncerning this <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſion comprized in the fourth and fifth Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> I have ſpoke ſo fully in the twenty firſt Chapter of this Treatiſe, that I may well be allowed to content my ſelf only with a <hi>ſummary</hi> Account of that Viſion here, which is this. This Viſion (impreſſed on the raptured Imagination of S. <hi>John</hi>) is a <hi>Theatrick</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Glory of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his <hi>Angelical</hi> or ſpiritual Kingdom in <hi>Heaven,</hi> which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that common uſe of all the <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſions (which is to ſignifie that the ſucceeding Prophecy, (as this <hi>Book</hi>-Prophecy in counterdiſtinction to the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolar</hi> Prophecy) is the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt obtained of God, and communicated to his Servant <hi>John</hi>) it is framed in ſuch a <hi>Dramatical</hi> way, as both to be <hi>prefigurative</hi> of ſeveral things appertaining to the glorious and joyful ſtate of the bleſſed <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> and alſo <hi>ſignificative</hi> what a <hi>dear regard</hi> God has to his <hi>Son Chriſt,</hi> even according to his <hi>humane Nature,</hi> and what an <hi>ineſtimable value</hi> is to be put upon this <hi>Book-Prophecy,</hi> in which is comprehended both the <hi>ſealed Book</hi>-Prophecy and the <hi>opened Book</hi>-Prophecy. This is a brief <hi>ſummary</hi> Account of this Viſion.</p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:34043:176"/>
               <p>In which we admit that the four Beaſts and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four-Elders, though they repreſent the ſpiritual or <hi>Angelical</hi> Kingdom in <hi>Heaven,</hi> are alſo <hi>prefigurative</hi> of <hi>Believers</hi> ſome time to be on Earth. We likewiſe further aſſert, That he that ſits on the Throne is <hi>God Almighty himſelf,</hi> and no other. That the <hi>ſlain Lamb</hi> is no other than Chriſt in his <hi>own Perſon.</hi> That the <hi>ſeven-ſealed Book</hi> is a Symbol of the ſecret Counſel and Foreknowledge of God touching the affairs or ſtate of his Church and of the World as much as concerns his Church from the beginning thereof to the laſt Judgment. And God his giving this Book to Chriſt, ſignifies his communicating theſe his Secrets to him. And the Lamb or Chriſt his <hi>opening</hi> the <hi>Seals</hi> in the ſight of <hi>John,</hi> denotes his imparting this Scene of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things to his Servant <hi>John,</hi> though no man yet underſtood the meaning of thoſe Typical Prefigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All this for my part I owne, whatever other Interpreters do. And now let us ſee what the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Objector can ſay to entangle ſo ſolid an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I demand only, ſays he, theſe few things. Firſt, Where was ever any ſuch loud Proclamation made at God's delivering this Book to his Son, as is ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.2?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, How unlikely a thing is it, that the things therein contained, being only in the Mind of God (as is ſuppoſed) there ſhould be any ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation made at all to find out one that was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to know them. For it may ſeem to be too much trifling in a weighty matter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, But if any ſuch Proclamation were ever made, who-ever heard it? For it muſt needs be ſuppoſed that the Proclamation was made in the ears of a great many.</p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:34043:176"/>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, And where was Chriſt when this Proclamation was made, that it is ſaid, No man in Heaven, in Earth, or under the Earth was found able to open the Book, or look on it?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly, But if the meaning be, that none but Chriſt was found able, how comes S. <hi>John</hi> to weep for that? Who could he expect or deſire ſhould do it beſides?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sixthly, How comes an Elder to know of Chriſt's taking the Book out of his Father's hand ſooner than S. <hi>John</hi> himſelf?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seventhly, What Elder was that that gave the firſt notice to S. <hi>John,</hi> that Chriſt had prevailed to do it?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Eighthly, Who are they all that are ſet ſo near the Throne of God and of Chriſt, as theſe Beaſts and Elders are ſaid to have been, when God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the knowledge of theſe things to his Son, and who are ſaid upon that occaſion to have ſung a new Song with Harps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to this effect: Thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to take the Book, and to open the ſeven Seals thereof; for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and haſt made us Kings and Prieſts unto God, and we ſhall reign upon the Earth. And there is the like reaſon of the Angelical Addreſs that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Ninthly, Interpreters interpreting this Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Addreſs, of Angels <hi>literally</hi> ſo called (as they alſo interpret the ſtrong Angel <hi>v.</hi> 2.) contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and all Interpreters in other places who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Angels to be meant of men.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Tenthly and laſtly, But the greateſt and moſt manifeſt Omiſſion of all, ſaith he, is that whereas in the next place it is ſaid, That every Creature in
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:34043:177"/>Heaven, in Earth, and under the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I <hi>John</hi> heard ſaying, Bleſſing and Honour and Glory and Power be unto him that ſitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever: no Interpreter ſhews this to have been done after Chriſt's taking of the Book, more than before. From whence it is plain to me, ſaith he, that they go upon a wrong Hypotheſis. For if there had been any ſuch things done on Earth, no doubt ſome footſteps of it would have been found in Hiſtory. Theſe few things, as he calls them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought by him preſſing and weighty, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to anſwer, that the truth of my Expoſition may not ſeem to be obſcured thereby.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the firſt then I anſwer, That this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was made only in this <hi>Dramatical</hi> Viſion, and is no more than a <hi>viſionary Proclamation,</hi> and brought in in this <hi>Dramatical</hi> manner to ſignifie the <hi>ſingular</hi> Prerogative of Chriſt given to him by his Father, that he ſhould have the ability of <hi>predicting</hi> and <hi>effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ſuch things as no Creature beſides in the World had the like; general Proclamation being made to find them out, if there were any ſuch. And the Angel is ſaid to be <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and his <hi>Voice loud,</hi> that it might pierce as it were through the Univerſe, to ſummon any one that would pretend to ſuch a Prerogative as has been deſcribed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the ſecond I ſay, There is neither any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likelineſs nor trifling in this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> becauſe it ſets off the <hi>peculiarneſs</hi> of Chriſt's Prerogative, in that it was given to <hi>him</hi> to open the <hi>ſealed Book.</hi> And it being not yet opened, but being known in general to be a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Secrets</hi> as yet only in the Mind of God, what unlikelineſs or <hi>Indecorum</hi> is it, that Proclamation be made <hi>who he is,</hi> that ſhall be
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:34043:177"/>
                  <hi>vouchſafed</hi> this power of opening the Book, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly knowing thoſe Secrets which were <hi>only</hi> in the <hi>Mind of God before?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To the third I anſwer as to the firſt, That the Proclamation is only <hi>viſionary,</hi> and of what it is <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificative</hi> I have already ſaid, nor need again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To the fourth, I ſay, it ſeems a kind of capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Query, as if it implied from that account of the Proclamation made, that no man in Heaven, on Earth, or under the Earth was found able to open the Book, that Chriſt was no where then, elſe he would have been found able. But as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27. But when he ſaith, all things are put under him, it is manifeſt he is excepted which did put all things under him; ſo ſay I, whenas this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was made to remonſtrate to the World, that no man in Heaven, nor Earth, nor under the Earth was found able, <hi>ſaving Chriſt himſelf,</hi> to open the Book, it is manifeſt he is to be excepted out of that <hi>Negative</hi> Catalogue, as being the only Creature that was able.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To the fifth, Incogitancy I think ſuggeſted this Query to the Objector. For it implies S. <hi>John</hi> wept <hi>after</hi> he underſtood that Chriſt had obtained the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of opening the ſealed Book, whenas his weeping was <hi>before.</hi> He ſays ſo plainly himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>And I wept much, becauſe no man was found worthy to open and read the Book, neither to look thereon.</hi> Which is alſo a <hi>Dramatical</hi> paſſage on this <hi>Theatre</hi> intended to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing elſe but the great <hi>Needfulneſs</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirableneſs</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Prophecies</hi> for the uſe of God's Church and their guidance in all the Toſſings, Changes and Revolutions in this tranſitory World.
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:34043:178"/>Such a Book was ſo neceſſary and requiſite, that it would grieve any good Chriſtian at the very heart, who is ſolicitous for the Church, to want ſuch a Load-ſtar or <hi>Cynoſura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. To the ſixth I anſwer, That theſe crowned El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, though they be <hi>prefigurative</hi> alſo of the <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> Kings or Monarchs, they are here ſome <hi>principal Angels</hi> of the ſpiritual Kingdom of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi> And why may not ſuch an Angel be thought to be wiſer than <hi>John,</hi> and able to inſtruct him. There is nothing incongruous or indecorous in this <hi>Dramatical</hi> paſſage, and <hi>John</hi> was called up into Heaven to be inſtructed by his Betters. This celeſtial Actor may well be conceived to know how the Scene would go, though <hi>John</hi> in the mean time was as yet ignorant thereof.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To the ſeventh. Truly this is a very curious Queſtion, if it imply that one ſhould declare who this crowned Elder was by <hi>Name.</hi> It is ſufficient to ſay it was one of the Elders that was <hi>next</hi> him, and ſo moſt conveniently placed to inſtruct <hi>John,</hi> and comfort him upon his weeping, and ſo take that kue to carry on this Divine Scene from <hi>v.</hi> 4. to <hi>v.</hi> 8. till the <hi>ſlain Lamb</hi> had taken the Book out of the hand of him that ſate on the Throne, and had obtained power to <hi>open</hi> it. By which no Event is prefigured that was to come to paſs ſome <hi>Ages</hi> after <hi>John</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> but it is only ſignified in this pompous <hi>Dramatical</hi> way, That this <hi>Book-Prophecy</hi> is the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> which <hi>God gave him,</hi> and which he imparted to his Servant <hi>John.</hi> So that the curioſity of naming the Party whom this Elder may prefigure, vaniſheth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To the eighth I ſay, Thoſe that are ſet ſo near
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:34043:178"/>the Throne of God are Members of his ſpiritual or <hi>Angelical</hi> Kingdom in <hi>Heaven,</hi> but <hi>prefigurative</hi> withal of his <hi>Millennial</hi> Kingdom on <hi>Earth,</hi> which is the main ſcope of his Providence over his Church, that it ſhall at laſt come to paſs, that the <hi>Heavenly Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> in <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Reſemblance</hi> ſhall deſcend <hi>from God</hi> on this <hi>Earth,</hi> and his Tabernacle be with men. And therefore the glory of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is here ſo repreſented, that it may alſo prefigure the State of the Church under the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> as the other <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſions have ſome glances or more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſtrokes at Prophetick Events in ſome paſſages. And now for the <hi>new Song</hi> ſung by the four Beaſts and twenty four Elders, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Dignus es qui acciperes,</hi> Thou wert worthy to receive the Book (for ſo the Original is interpretable) and to open the Seals thereof; for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us to God, and made us Kings and Prieſts to reign upon Earth: This <hi>new Song</hi> is prefigurative of the Joy and Happineſs of that State of the Church, of which it is ſaid, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.5. Behold, I make all things <hi>new,</hi> which is the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate. In which there will be ſuch triumphant Praiſes ſung un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lamb, when it will be ſo evident he has car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Church ſafe, for whom he gave his Life and Blood, through all the predicted conditions thereof, and at laſt has placed them in that happy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Millennial</hi> State by his <hi>faithful Conduct, Wiſdom and Power.</hi> Which are included in the Faculty granted him by his Father of <hi>opening</hi> the <hi>Seals</hi> of the Book, as I have noted elſewhere. And whenas pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently afterwards the whole Univerſe is made to ring with a loud Doxology from numerous Quires of Angels and of all Creatures in Heaven and Earth
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:34043:179"/>and under the Earth, and ſuch as are in the Sea, and all that are in them, to <hi>him</hi> that <hi>ſits upon the Throne,</hi> and unto the <hi>Lamb,</hi> to what times poſſibly can this belong but to the holy, happy and glorious <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> Reign of Chriſt in his Saints upon Earth? The Song of the twenty four Elders and four Beaſts <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure</hi> the Joy of the <hi>Millennial Monarchs</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> that of the <hi>Angels</hi> the Joy of the Angels in Heaven at this flouriſhing State of the Church on Earth, and that of the reſt of the Creatures the Conviction of all the World, that the Lord Jeſus was no leſs than he declared himſelf to be, the Son of God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World, to whom the <hi>Father</hi> had <hi>given</hi> all <hi>Power</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> of which this <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial State</hi> of the Church is a moſt illuſtrious and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Effect</hi> filling all the World with wonder and amazement. And this I hope may ſatisfie the eighth Query.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Ninthly, To the ninth Allegation I anſwer, That the Doxology of the Angelical Quires does <hi>prefigure</hi> the Joy of Angels in <hi>Heaven</hi> for that bleſſed condition of the Church in the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate on <hi>Earth.</hi> So that though this Viſion which is a Repreſentation of the glory of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his Spiritual or <hi>Angelical</hi> Kingdom, in the <hi>Dramati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> frame of things, is ſo contrived, that the four and twenty <hi>crowned</hi> Elders and four <hi>Beaſts</hi> prefigure alſo the <hi>Monarchs</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> yet there are left numerous Quires of Angels in <hi>counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction</hi> to theſe to ſignifie Angels <hi>literally</hi> ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the Song is to ſignifie their Joy at this State of the Church on Earth. Nor has that ſtrong Angel that makes the Proclamation any other ſenſe than ſo, that he was one of the <hi>Angelical</hi> Retinue of the God
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:34043:179"/>of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Heaven. Nor is that Rule of interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angels of men in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> univerſally true, I am ſure not in the <hi>Introductory</hi> Viſions. The word <hi>Angel</hi> occurs in ſeveral places of the <hi>Introductory</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions where it ſtands for an Angel <hi>literally</hi> ſo called, not for a man, to ſay nothing of other places. So little force has this ninth Allegation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And laſtly for the tenth, which urges, That if there had been any ſuch univerſal Doxology to <hi>Him</hi> that <hi>ſits</hi> on the <hi>Throne</hi> and to the <hi>Lamb</hi> after he had taken the Book, that there would have been ſome traces or footſteps of it in Hiſtory. To this I anſwer, That it is a marvellous groundleſs conceit and expectation, that what is here Parabolically and <hi>Dramatically</hi> ſet down only to expreſs that Joy and Happineſs which would redound to the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Chriſt's being inveſted with this Power of opening the <hi>ſeven-ſealed Book,</hi> that is, to be enabled both to <hi>foretel</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> the affairs of his Church ſo, as that the ſtate thereof will be ſo <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous</hi> at <hi>laſt</hi> here upon Earth, that all the World will be convinced of his ſtupendious <hi>Foreſight, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Power:</hi> that therefore there ſhall be ſuch an univerſal <hi>Te Deum—</hi> ſung to him throughout the whole Univerſe at once, ſo that the Solemnity might be recorded in Hiſtory. This is not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prophetick Stile. And beſides if it were, the time is not yet come when this is to be. For ſuch expreſſions as theſe can ſuit with no meaner State of the Church on the Earth, than that of the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennial</hi> Reign; when the four and twenty <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Monarchs</hi> including both the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> Sovereigns or Princes, may ſeaſonably ſing this Song, <hi>Thou haſt redeemed us with thy blood, and made us
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:34043:180"/>Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reign upon Earth,</hi> viz. in Chriſt's <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire. But to expect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of ſuch a Doxology in Hiſtory before the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xology has been, is a great <hi>Incongruity.</hi> Wherefore I hope any indifferent eye may eaſily diſcern, that notwithſtanding all theſe <hi>ten</hi> Allegations, my Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this Viſion, comprized in the fourth and fifth Chapters of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> is <hi>unexceptionably true.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THE firſt Objection. Every day in the forty two months ſignifying a year, makes in the whole twelve hundred ſeventy ſeven years at leaſt, there being really in every year (not three hundred and ſixty, but) three hundred and ſixty five days. This ſeems to make the three Times and an Half or forty two months and twelve hundred and ſixty days not to be the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:34043:180"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the forty two months are <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Months, and conſiſt of juſt thirty days apiece, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, in that thirty times forty two make juſt twelve hundred and ſixty days. And theſe days and thoſe months are the time of the mourning of the Witneſſes and of that which all along occaſions their mourning, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>outer</hi> Court being trodden down by the Gentiles, which is a plain indication that the twelve hundred and ſixty days are a note of no more nor leſs time than the forty two months, and that therefore they muſt be <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Months. And as it is plain that the <hi>months</hi> are <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> ſo we muſt conceive that the <hi>years</hi> in the three Times and an Half are ſo many <hi>Aegyptian</hi> years and an half conſiſting of <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Months, which therefore make, each of them, three hundred and ſixty days. See <hi>Rev. Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 14. This is their ſolid Year conſiſting of ſo many months, to which they add the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as they are called, the <hi>Dies adjectitii,</hi> which are five, which here the Spirit of Prophecy takes no notice of, but reſolving the forty two <hi>Aegyptian</hi> months, which is three ſolid <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Years and an half, into juſt twelve hundred and ſixty days, ſhows that no more years than ſo are to be underſtood thereby. And this not reſpecting at all the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or five <hi>adjectitious</hi> days in this Compute of the Time of the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> (all which ſynchronize one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother) complies excellently well with that Truth which I have made out, <hi>viz.</hi> That the eventual mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> is not a <hi>Year</hi> (which has been thought hitherto ſo to be) but a <hi>Semi-time,</hi> in reſpect of which <hi>ſeventeen years</hi> or more is not at all conſiderable. So that there was no need of being ſo preciſe as to take the <hi>Dies adjectitii</hi> into the Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:34043:181"/>and ſo to make the whole twelve hundred and ſeventy ſeven years at leaſt, as you would infer. Wherefore though every day in the forty two months ſtands for a year, yet theſe months being <hi>Aegyptian</hi> months, and conſiſting of juſt thirty days apiece, and there is the ſame reaſon of the three Times and an Half, it will not amount to twelve hundred and ſeventy ſeven, but twelve hundred and ſixty years only.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The words in the Text, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 18. are theſe. By theſe were the third part of men killed by the Fire and by the Smoak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is to ſay, whenas the <hi>Saracens vexed</hi> the Roman Empire, but could not <hi>utterly ſubdue</hi> it, and ſo ſeize on it and poſſeſs it, the <hi>Turks</hi> quite vanquiſhed it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire by thoſe <hi>Fire-Guns</hi> in the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſo ſeizing on the whole <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire, which they have done for ſo long a time. So that the Prophecy ſeems to reſpect thoſe times more eſpecially when <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was taken, as appears from <hi>v.</hi> 15. alſo. And the Angels were looſed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to ſlay the third part of men, that is, utterly to ſubdue them, and to ſeize and poſſeſs the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Roman Empire. For from the Inauguration of <hi>Togrulbec</hi> by <hi>Caliph Chaiim Biam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla</hi> to the year <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was taken, is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical day and a month and a year, that is, three
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:34043:181"/>hundred ninety ſix years. And the uſe of <hi>Fire-Guns</hi> in that taking of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is notorious, as you may ſee in <hi>Laonicus Chalcocondylas De Rebus Turci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> one of the <hi>Byzantine</hi> Hiſtorians, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. who there makes mention of a Cannon of ſo vaſt a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it was fain to be drawn by ſeventy yoke of Oxen and two thouſand men. You may gueſs at the reſt by this as to the uſe of <hi>Fire-Guns</hi> in the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the third part of men. And the vaſt number that is ſaid to be at this Siege, <hi>v.</hi> 16. two hundred thouſand thouſand, I ſay by this definite vaſt number is underſtood an huge indefinite number; as indeed there was at the Siege of this <hi>one</hi> City, <hi>viz.</hi> about four hundred thouſand, as <hi>Laonicus Chalcocondylas</hi> ſets it down in the ſame place: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Which is another intimation that the Prophecy has an eye to this famous Siege. But this only by the bye.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Prophecy pointing chiefly at this Atchievement of the <hi>Turks,</hi> there is no neceſſity at all that the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould be conceived to have had the uſe of <hi>Fire-Guns</hi> from their very firſt irruption into the Empire. And though their irruption was ninety one years before the uſe of <hi>Fire-Guns,</hi> yet it was above ſeventy years before the <hi>Turks</hi> took <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> that the uſe of Fire-Guns was known in War. And if <hi>Zieglerus</hi> his account be as Authentick as <hi>Alſtedius</hi> his, which for ought I know it may be, that <hi>German</hi> invention of <hi>Guns</hi> was about the year 1354. and then the uſe of Guns will be an <hi>hundred</hi> years before the <hi>Turks</hi> took <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Nor is it requiſite in the Prophetick Repreſentations of any Body Politick, that thoſe Characters it is ſet out by be every one of them of the ſame continuance with the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:34043:182"/>ſaid Body, but that they be <hi>notorious</hi> and of a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick</hi> nature, and ſuch as tends to the aſſuring the ſenſe of the Viſion. An Obſervation ſo obviouſly true, that I need not at all inſiſt thereon: which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone may ſerve to take away this ſcruple.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Object.</hi> In the 359. page of <hi>Arithmetica Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyptica</hi> the number twelve hundred and ſixty varied into forty two months, makes three hundred and ſixty days to each year; but in <hi>Apocalypſis Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſeos, pag.</hi> 87. the year is three hundred ſixty five, the Prophetick day, month and year being there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted three hundred ninety ſix years. The reaſon of this difference I underſtand not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here again the account is <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is taken for granted, that the month is juſt thirty days. And the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> year here has its <hi>full</hi> extent, that is, the <gap reason="foreign">

But the pinch of the ſcruple is this, Why ſhould the <hi>full</hi> Aegyptian year be made uſe of here, and take in the five <hi>adjectitious</hi> days, when only the twelve <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> months is the ſolid year in that place of <hi>Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica Apocalyptica</hi> here noted, leaving out the five <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectitious</hi> Days? But the reaſon of this is obvious enough. For here the Spirit of Prophecy intended to foretel an Event, <hi>viz.</hi> the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to the <hi>preciſeneſs</hi> of a <hi>year,</hi> as is plainly inſinuated by the mentioning a <hi>ſingle</hi> day, and therefore there was a neceſſity of computing the time, not by thirteen months and a day, but by a day and a month and a
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:34043:182"/>year, including all the days therein, the five <hi>adjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> days not excepted. But, as was noted in my Anſwer to the firſt Objection, the Eventual meaſure or <hi>

               <p>THIS fourth Objection is this, The four An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels which are looſed (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 15.) <hi>An.

For it ſeems to me, that their being prepared for ſo long a time implies, that at the Expiration of that time, the power given them to kill the third part of men, will expire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection looks handſomly and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly on't at the firſt ſight, and it is a very deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing to us Chriſtians that it ſhould be ſolid and true. But the grounds thereof I conceive are not firm: For it only ſuppoſes, does not prove that the looſing the four Angels, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1289. is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent year to the <hi>Epocha</hi> of three hundred ninety ſix years, at the ending whereof they ſhall have ſlain the third part of men. For firſt, though three hundred
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:34043:183"/>ninety ſix added to twelve hundred eighty nine make ſixteen hundred eighty five, yet it is a preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious buſineſs to place the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ninety ſix years after, and not in the very Year 1289. Moreover, if the Year 1289. be the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the three hundred ninety ſix years, the <hi>Turks</hi> will have done their buſineſs of ſlaying the <hi>third part</hi> of men, that is, of aboliſhing the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, quite vanquiſhing it and poſſeſſing it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and utterly extinguiſhing the Succeſſion of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Emperours above two hundred years before the Expiration of theſe three hundred ninety ſix years, wherein they were to do the Feat.

                  <hi>Togrulbec</hi> was inaugurated Emperour of the <hi>Turks</hi> in the Year 1057. and the Angels let looſe in the Year 1289. ſo that the time of their being bound in the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> is two hundred thirty two years. All which time they were <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>CHAP. XXXVII. <hi>Why the Author of the</hi> Apocalypſis Apocalypſeos <hi>did only take up as an</hi> Hypotheſis, <hi>but not formally</hi> prove [<hi>that when there is any promiſe or threatning</hi> before <hi>the</hi> Epiphonema <hi>in the Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches, it indicates things</hi> Political <hi>touching the State on Earth; but if placed</hi> after <hi>the</hi> Epiphone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, <hi>an inviſible State or Concerns of the other World] and yet adventured to argue therefrom.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS mentioned, in the Argument, I muſt confeſs is taken up as an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> nor did I ever go about to prove it, the fitneſs of the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it proving it ſelf to be a true <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that is, not a mere <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> but a <hi>real Truth.</hi> And what way was there to prove it but by <hi>Induction,</hi> advertiſing it was true in every part? Which I will now intimate to make a ſupply for the former defect. And firſt we will conſider thoſe promiſes that come <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> they being the feweſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting only the three firſt Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>It is evident, that the Promiſe <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Epiphone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Church [I will give to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God] is underſtood of the ſtate of the other Life, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> as is manifeſt from <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. And ſo the promiſe <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> to the Church in <hi>Smyrna</hi> [Shall not be hurt by the ſecond Death] this is plainly a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of being made partakers of the <hi>firſt Reſurrection,</hi> as appears from <hi>Apoc. Chap.</hi> 20.6. And it is the ſenſe
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:34043:185"/>of the Primitive Church on this place, as you may ſee in Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> And ſo reſpects the ſtate of the other life. And laſtly, the promiſe to the Church in <hi>Pergamus</hi> after the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> it is plain it is not of a <hi>viſible</hi> and Political nature, but of things <hi>inviſible, viz.</hi> [to eat of the hidden Manna] and [to receive a white Stone and a new Name therein written, which no man knoweth, ſaving he that receiveth it] This is no <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>viſible</hi> State, but ſpiritual and <hi>inviſible.</hi> So that the <hi>Induction</hi> is full and firm tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Promiſes <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> ſo far as they go. And theſe immediately <hi>following</hi> the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonema,</hi> being of an <hi>inviſible</hi> and ſpiritual nature, it is a fair hint that thoſe that immediately <hi>precede</hi> ſhould be of a <hi>viſible</hi> nature and <hi>Political,</hi> and that as well in the reſt of the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> as the three firſt. But we ſhall make it good in every one of them.</p>
               <p>Now therefore for that Threatning to the Church in <hi>Epheſus</hi> [I will remove thy Candleſtick out of its place] All Interpreters agree that it concerns the <hi>viſible</hi> State of the Church, as it is manifeſt that <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Church.</hi> And it is as eaſie and natural an Interpretation of [to be removed out of its place] to be <hi>moved from</hi> the <hi>ſtate</hi> and condition it was in, namely, of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>rest</hi> to that of <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>perſecution.</hi> Which Commination was made good in the very next Interval. The Church in <hi>Smyrna</hi> being exerciſed with no leſs than <hi>ten</hi> Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. And ſo that promiſe to the Church in <hi>Smyrna</hi> that precedes the <hi>Epiphonema</hi> [I will give thee the Crown of life] Foraſmuch as it corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponds ſo well with the <hi>Crown</hi> that is given to the <hi>Rider of the white Horſe</hi> under the <hi>firſt Seal,</hi> which is the <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> and this promiſe was made

And in the promiſes to the Church in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> before the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> they are all along <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>viſible.</hi> As that of the Synagogue of Satan worſhipping before her feet. The Caution alſo, that no man take her <hi>Crown,</hi> that <hi>Political</hi> Sovereignty intended for her. And her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Pillar</hi> in the Temple of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> intimates a <hi>permanent viſible</hi> State of that Church, and the Name of the <hi>City</hi> of my God the <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> is a moſt manifeſt indication of a <hi>Political</hi> ſenſe indeed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it being ſo evident in theſe four, <hi>Epheſus, Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Thyatira</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that the Threatning and Promiſes are of a nature <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi> that <hi>precede</hi> the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> if the Threatning or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the other three will bear this ſenſe, we are in all reaſon to conclude, that ſuch a ſenſe belongs unto them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore that Threatning to the Church in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus</hi> [I will come unto thee quickly] according to that moſt conſtant tenour of the ſenſe before the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:34043:187"/>
                  <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> muſt fignifie ſome <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>external</hi> dealing with thoſe in the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> here blamed and threatned ſeverely, but conjoined with a <hi>Commination</hi> alſo againſt the Enemies of the <hi>True Church,</hi> or againſt the <hi>Falſe one</hi> the <hi>Baalamites.</hi> The fighting againſt whom with the Sword of his mouth (which is the Word of God convincingly preached) is the attacquing and fetching off whole Nations by the preaching of the Word (which is that Sword of the Spirit) from the <hi>Baalamitiſh</hi> Church to the pure Faith of Chriſt, which accordingly came to paſs in the next Interval. In which this fighting with the Sword of his mouth continued ſo much in earneſt, that in the cloſe it cut off <hi>whole Kingdoms</hi> from the Idolatrous Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So well is the <hi>Political</hi> ſenſe of theſe Threatnings verified by the Event. See my Expoſition on <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 16. And now for the Promiſes to thoſe few Names in <hi>Sardis</hi> of being [cloathed in white raiment] That that Phraſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies proſperous ſucceſs in affairs in the Prophetick Stile, is a thing undoubted; and ſo he that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh [the <hi>not blotting</hi> out his Name out of the Book of Life] is the like indication of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and increaſe of thoſe <hi>few Names,</hi> or pure and unſpotted Chriſtians, till they emerge into the Name of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church, nay of the <hi>New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> it ſelf, not extinct, though diſguiſed at the laſt under the Name of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which laſteth even to the very <hi>Conflagration.</hi> And this I think is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent completion of this Promiſe of [not being blotted out of the Book of Life] in ſuch a ſenſe as the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown</hi> promiſed to the Church in <hi>Smyrna</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Crown of Life,</hi> ſignifying their ſecurity from the Perſecutions of the <hi>red Dragon,</hi> and here the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:34043:188"/>proſperity and ſecurity of the Church (whoſe ſeed were thoſe few Names in <hi>Sardis</hi>) from all their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, even to the end of the World, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog</hi> being not able to take the holy City. Such ſhall be the ſucceſs of thoſe <hi>few Names</hi> in <hi>Sardis,</hi> for which they are alſo in a more ſpecial manner recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to God by Chriſt, and to the Miniſtry of his holy Angels. And from whom but theſe can the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church and <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> ſpring? So eaſie and natural is the application of thoſe Promiſes made to theſe <hi>few Names</hi> in <hi>Sardis</hi> to an external and <hi>Political</hi> ſenſe. Whence we may be ſure that that is the ſenſe here as well as in other ſuch like Promiſes in the other Epiſtles <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Epiphonema.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now laſtly, For the Promiſe to him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> viz. <hi>That he ſhall ſit down with Chriſt in his Throne,</hi> &amp;c. That this Promiſe is of a nature <hi>external</hi> and <hi>Political,</hi> or hugely akin to it, is plain from hence, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof will be at that general <hi>viſible</hi> and indeed moſt <hi>illuſtrious</hi> Aſſizes, when there will be the Appearance of all the dead before the Tribunal of Chriſt, and the <hi>Saints</hi> as <hi>Co-aſſeſſours</hi> with Chriſt ſhall in their Thrones judge the lapſed Angels. So that though I have argued from the above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> as then ſeeming <hi>but</hi> an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> yet the obvious Applicability thereof to the explaining theſe Epiſtles, and the now diſtinct proof that it is a true <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> or a <hi>real Truth,</hi> ſhows that it is a ſafe Topick to argue from. Which was the thing aimed at.</p>

XXXVIII. <hi>Four Objections taken out of a Letter of a learned and ingenious Friend touching the Kingdom of Chriſt on Earth, as if all his</hi> ſuffering Adherents <hi>ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in that Kingdom in the</hi> New Jeruſalem; <hi>with Anſwers thereto.</hi>

               <p>THE firſt Objection upon <hi>Apocalypſis Apocaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſeos, pag.</hi> 4. To be Kings and Prieſts unto God ſignifies as much as a Sacerdotal Kingdom, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.6. a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>reigning</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; <hi>Sacerdotal,</hi> becauſe of their <hi>Prieſtly</hi> Employ; and in ſome places (as <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.6.) becauſe of the <hi>unſtainedneſs</hi> of their condition as to Externals. Now it is acknowledged that there is a <hi>Kingdom</hi> deſigned here on <hi>Earth</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Chriſtianity, and there are a great many places that ſeem to promiſe all his faithful Adherents, at leaſt his faithful <hi>ſuffering</hi> Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, of all times, a ſhare in the glory and felicity of that <hi>Kingdom-Eſtate,</hi> as if the <hi>Martyrs</hi> of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive</hi> Times and of <hi>all</hi> Times ſhould have a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for their Sufferings in the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate of things, as <hi>Apoc.

And <hi>pag.</hi> 23. of <hi>Apoc. Apocalypſeos</hi> it is ſaid the <hi>bright</hi> Morning-Star be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Interval, which is at a great diſtance from the <hi>Thyatirian;</hi> how ſhall the <hi>Martyrs</hi>

Or what will ſuch a promiſed felicity ſignifie to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, wherein not they, but their Succeſſors only of following times are to have an intereſt? It is needleſs to mention many other places that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this matter. But I could never untye this knot of difficulties in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> that is, I could never conceive it poſſible that <hi>Chriſtian Sufferers</hi> of <hi>all</hi> Times and Ages ſhould partake of the <hi>Jeruſalem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate</hi> of things, nor how the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> can be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted ſo, as not to aſſert it. Which is the more probable, becauſe the Kingdom-ſtate, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for Chriſt, is a kind of Heavenly Kingdom-ſtate upon Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate is nothing elſe but the Triumph of the <hi>truly Apoſtolick</hi> Church emerging into Univerſal Power above their Enemies into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed Peace and an Heavenly Holineſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation here upon Earth. Which at laſt ſhe will obtain, and it is an encouragement to the <hi>preſent</hi> ſuffering Martyrs, that the cauſe they ſuffer for, will at laſt appear ſo glorious and triumphant here on Earth, while they in the mean time are better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in Heaven, and it were a bidding them to their loſs to have them exchange their <hi>Heavenly</hi> fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity for this <hi>Earthly,</hi> though gloriouſly flouriſhing condition. And laſtly, look but on the <hi>Apoſtolick Church,</hi> according as the Prophetick Stile repreſents it, as <hi>one continued Body</hi> from the beginning to the end, and all theſe promiſes to the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> and <hi>Thyatirian</hi> Sufferers are made good to them, as being ſtill the ſame Body of the Church in their Succeſſors. Nor is this <hi>Heaventy Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt upon Earth
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:34043:189"/>otherwiſe to be underſtood <hi>Heavenly,</hi> than that the Spirit and Converſation of Chriſtians in the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate will be truly <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Heavenly.</hi> So that I ſee no difficulty at all in this Point, if we rightly conceive the matter. And it will further eaſe the Reader's mind, if he conſider what I have writ <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. That though the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> be a <hi>Prophecy</hi> of an excellent State of the Church on <hi>Earth,</hi> yet the deſcription of that State is an <hi>intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Type</hi> alſo of the State of the Church <hi>Triumphant</hi> in Heaven.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Upon <hi>pag.</hi> 22, 23. To have power over the Nations ſeems to ſignifie, That <hi>he</hi> ſhall be of Power over Nations or of <hi>Regal</hi> Dignity in that Kingdom-eſtate upon Earth, which is deſigned for Chriſt by his Father, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.27. And the promiſe of the <hi>Morning-Star</hi> confirms ſuch an Interpretation. For it is the <hi>Star</hi> of <hi>Empire,</hi> and the <hi>white Raiment</hi> promiſed <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.5. is an Enſign of <hi>Regal</hi> Dignity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ingenious Objector ſeems to miſtake in the propriety of the <hi>Prophetick</hi> Stile, which as in the <hi>Symbol</hi> of a <hi>Woman,</hi> a <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Beaſt,</hi> does not intimate one ſingle <hi>Individual,</hi> but a <hi>Body</hi> of men and their ſucceſſion, ſo by the ſingle perſon <hi>[He]</hi> is not meant this or that ſingle Man, but the whole ſucceſſive Body of men that are Overcomers; which according to the Prophetick Stile are ſignified by this ſingle perſon <hi>[He]</hi> Thoſe that ſtand out through Faith and Patience to the laſt in thoſe Countries where the <hi>Pagano-Chriſtians</hi> domineered over them, theſe with their Princes and Rulers will have the Dominion over the Pagano-Chriſtians, and will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the beginning or commencement of the great Empire of Chriſt. So far as the Father of our Lord
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:34043:190"/>Chriſt has enlarged his Kingdom in the <hi>Sardian</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, ſo far theſe <hi>Overcomers</hi> partake thereof with him. And this <hi>Sardian</hi> State of the Kingdom of Chriſt is the promiſed <hi>Morning-Star,</hi> but the <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem ſtate</hi> the <hi>bright Morning-Star.</hi> And laſtly, Though white Raiment may be a <hi>Regal</hi> Enſign, yet it is moſt ſafely interpreted of <hi>proſperous Succeſs,</hi> and may anſwer to that in the next Epiſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 8.

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Upon <hi>pag.</hi> 31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is obſervable touching the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that there are many paſſages that repreſent her in a ſtate of Tryal. She is ſaid to have a <hi>little ſtrength,</hi> and to have kept the word of <hi>Chriſt's Patience,</hi> ſhe is exhorted to hold faſt that which ſhe hath, that ſhe loſe not the Crown for which ſhe was conflicting, ſhe is exhorted to overcome, and encouraged to behave her ſelf heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. Now, Sir, how will this agree with the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate of the Church? Beſides, it is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the <hi>Philadelphians</hi> as a thing to come, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.12. But it is more obſervable that it is promiſed to the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> that their Chriſtian Champions ſhall be <hi>Citizens</hi> of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and that Chriſt will write upon them his <hi>new Name,</hi> which I believe you rightly interpret <hi>King of Kings,</hi> &amp;c. This therefore ſeems to countenance what I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That all Chriſt's <hi>ſuffering Adherents</hi> ſhall have a ſhare of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-felicity here on Earth, and have preferments in that Kingdom-Eſtate. Which may ſeem to be further countenanced from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Laodicea, Chap.</hi> 3.21. That they ſhall ſit with Chriſt on his Throne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection is grounded on a miſtake, as if the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Interval and <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate

Wherefore thoſe Exhortations belong to that part of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Interval that goes before the <hi>Jeruſalem-ſtate.</hi> Whence their emerging at laſt into that ſtate, is promiſed to them as a thing to come. Now as for their Chriſtian Champions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if it were underſtood of ſome ſelect Perſons, this difficulty is grounded upon the old miſtake, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>[He]</hi> ſignifies a <hi>particular</hi> perſon, whenas in the Prophetick ſenſe and ſtile it here ſignifies the <hi>whole Body</hi> of the faithful <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> predicting that that ſort of men, by their Faith, Patience and powerful preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom, will at laſt have ſo glorious and victorious ſucceſs, that they with their Succeſſours ſhall bring in the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate or <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire of Chriſt; ſo that all that is predicted of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be fulfilled in them here on Earth, while all Chriſt's <hi>ſuffering Adherents</hi> in the mean that are dead, enjoy themſelves in <hi>Heaven.</hi> As for the Promiſe to the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Overcomers, it is not the promiſe of an <hi>Earthly</hi> Throne, but an Heavenly, as to be Aſſiſtents of Chriſt coming to judge the <hi>People,</hi> as the <hi>Word</hi> ſignifies in the Cloſe of this Interval of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Church: which Interval may be ſo denominated, as for other reaſons, ſo haply by way of Alluſion to <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s <hi>Laodicea combuſta</hi> (as I have more than once noted) the <hi>Conflagration</hi> cloſing this Interval.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. Notwithſtanding the great Learning which you have employ'd, Sir, in the Expoſition of the ſeven Churches, it ſeems a ſomewhat lubricous buſineſs. But the reſt of your Expoſition is matter of much greater Certainty. But it is no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:34043:191"/>for any man that is thus aſſured of the truth and meaning of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> as to the <hi>main purport</hi> of it, to acknowledge there is great difficulty in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting ſeveral <hi>particular</hi> paſſages. Touching the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> I cannot but obſerve, that there are a great many paſſages in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> which ſeem to argue the time will come, when <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Son of God</hi> will hold his Eſtate and Court here upon Earth. Which how ſtrange ſoever it may ſeem; is not ſo ſtrange as that the Son of God ſhould be crucified here upon Earth. And if this Hypotheſis might be thought ſolid and well grounded, all the paſſages of this Book aforementioned and many more, would be ſufficiently clear, and the deſcription of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> in the two laſt Chapters would be eaſily intelligible, which I think cannot be well underſtood without it. Theſe places, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 15. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15. ſound this way, at ſuch a rate, that they almoſt force me, whether I will or no, to believe ſome ſuch thing. But how far and in what manner theſe things may be true, may be troubleſom to conceive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This buſineſs would not ſeem ſo lubricous to the learned Objector, if his Reaſon and Phancy was but once well inured to that Figure of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Stile, which we call <hi>Henopoeia,</hi> which takes not place only in a <hi>Man, Woman</hi> or <hi>Beaſt,</hi> made the <hi>Symbols</hi> of ſome <hi>Society</hi> or <hi>Body Politick:</hi> But the Pronoun [He] which ſo often occurs in theſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to the Churches, has alſo in it this Figure, and ſignifies not a ſingle Perſon, but ſuch a Body or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men ſo or ſo behaving themſelves together with their Succeſſours. This <hi>ſucceſſive</hi> Body by a Prophetick <hi>Henopoeia</hi> is repreſented as <hi>one ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:34043:191"/>by the Pronoun [He] He that overcometh. This once admitted, all difficulties vaniſh as to the ſeven Churches. And if the Objector did but obſerve how full of <hi>Hylaſmus's</hi> and <hi>Iſraeliſmus's</hi> the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Stile is, he would eaſily be reconciled to ſuch a ſenſe of theſe places of the twenty firſt and twenty ſecond of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> as the <hi>Expoſitor</hi> has given of them, though they bear ſo hard upon his Phancy for the preſent, as to drive him to expect a perſonal Reign of Chriſt upon Earth. Conſider alſo here what we intimated above, That the Deſcription of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is ſo drawn, as to be a <hi>Type</hi> alſo of the Church <hi>Triumphant</hi> in Heaven. But to proceed. We averr moreover, That Chriſt's <hi>Perſonal Reign</hi> here on Earth would be infinitely more ſtrange than his Suffering here, becauſe the Reaſons of this <hi>latter</hi> are ſo palpable. But I ſee no reaſon at all for a <hi>Perſonal</hi> Reign of Chriſt upon Earth; whenas the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt within us, in that meaſure and efficacy it will be in thoſe days, will ſerve all intents and purpoſes that his <hi>Perſonal</hi> Reign can be ſuppoſed to ſerve to. And this reigning by his <hi>Spirit</hi> is a greater perfection in his Church, than if he ſhould guide them by his <hi>perſonal Preſence</hi> and <hi>Voice</hi> here on <hi>Earth. Inward Regeneration</hi> by the operation of the Spirit into the <hi>living</hi> Image of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is a greater Priviledge, I ſay, than to be guided by the <hi>external Perſon</hi> and <hi>Voice</hi> of Chriſt amongſt us ſounding in our ears. As, if the thing could be, it were better for an <hi>Horſe</hi> to be turned into a <hi>perfect man,</hi> than to be <hi>rid</hi> by the <hi>bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt Heros</hi> that is. And laſtly, That Opinion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the <hi>ſuffering</hi> Adherents to Chriſt, that they ſhould become Citizens of this <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> on Earth, which is conjoined with the Opinion of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:34043:192"/>Chriſt's <hi>perſonal Reign,</hi> is not agreeable to Reaſon, in that it brings down the perſecuted <hi>Saints great Reward</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> which Chriſt promiſeth, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.12. to a <hi>leſſer reward</hi> here on <hi>Earth.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXXIX. <hi>Two Objections more out of the ſame Letter: The first touching the</hi> Palm-bearing <hi>Company, whether they ſynchronize with the</hi> New Jeruſalem. <hi>The other touching the Intricateneſs and Obſcurity of the</hi> Viſion <hi>of the</hi> two Witneſſes; <hi>With Anſwers to both Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE firſt Objection is upon <hi>pag.</hi> 67. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Arguments, ſaith he, for the Synchroniſm of the <hi>Palm-bearing</hi> Company with the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> ſeems not firm. If they were, and we could be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that the <hi>Palm-bearing</hi> Company were <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> Citizens of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> it would argue that the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate is deſigned to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miant to the <hi>ſuffering</hi> Chriſtians. And indeed it ſeems to be the main ſcope of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict that Divine ſtate of things. But however the <hi>Palm-bearing</hi> Company are plainly the <hi>Triumphant Army of Martyrs,</hi> and are of great affinity with thoſe <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. ſaving only that the <hi>latter</hi> are the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> under <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the former ſeem to be the <hi>Martyrs</hi> under <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> And ſince theſe Martyrs are deſcribed as <hi>perſonally</hi> rewarded with their white Robes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it would be ſtrange for us to think they are rewarded by <hi>Proxy</hi> in the proſperity of <hi>others</hi> in the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate. Beſides, that it is too early of
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:34043:192"/>the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> to have a formal Viſion of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the <hi>Palm-bearing</hi> Company ſynchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizes in part with the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> beſides what Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> alledges, the <hi>Methodicalneſs</hi> of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe</hi> may aſſure us. For the prefixing of the 144000 ſealed ones, with the Reſidue of that Viſion in that Chapter <hi>before</hi> the <hi>ſeven Trumpets,</hi> is according to <hi>exquiſite</hi> Method, the ſeven Trumpets being a more diſtinct and particular Repreſentation of the affairs of the ſame Time. Nor does it follow from the <hi>Palm-bearing</hi> Company's being Citizens of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> that thoſe <hi>individual</hi> Martyrs that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either under <hi>Paganiſm</hi> or <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> that they live in the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> here on <hi>Earth,</hi> but, by a Prophetick <hi>Henopoeia,</hi> the <hi>whole ſucceſſive Body</hi> of the pure Apoſtolick ſuffering Church under the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Antichriſt being underſtood; when this <hi>one ſucceeding Body</hi> emerges out of their Perſecutions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Victory over the Beaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then <hi>they</hi> become the <hi>Turba palmifera,</hi> and that gradually: Firſt, in the <hi>Sardian</hi> Interval; after more gloriouſly and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly in the <hi>Philadelphian,</hi> which is coincident with the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi> Nor need they be thought, thoſe that ſuffered under <hi>Antichriſt</hi> or the <hi>Dragon,</hi> to be, in the proſperity of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate, rewarded by a <hi>Proxy</hi> (which is wittily expreſſed) they, according to the Genius of the Apocalyptick Stile, being looked upon as the <hi>ſame individual Body Politick</hi> ſtill, as it is manifeſt in the Riſing of the two Witneſſes. And laſtly, It is not <hi>too early</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> to have the <hi>Jeruſalem-ſtate</hi> glanced at in a Viſion Synchronal to the ſeven Trumpets, which reach to the laſt Judgment, and therefore include
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:34043:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>in them the Time of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> the ligher glances at which partake of the nature of that fuller deſcription, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. and therefore are alſo <hi>Typical</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs Triumphant</hi> State in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our twentieth Chapter again of this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Upon <hi>pag.</hi> 102. The Viſion of the two Witneſſes hath always ſeemed to me one of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcureſt parts of the <hi>Book-Prophecy.</hi> And he that reads what you have written on that Subject with due conſideration, will be apt to think it is ſcarce poſſible to employ more Wit than you have done to void the difficulties of it. There are ſeveral things in the buſineſs of this Prophecy that ſeem to me of rational Conception. (1) It is rational to think that the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> ſpeaks <hi>ſtilo Judaico,</hi> as all men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>quòd ſaepiſſimè</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. (2) That theſe two Witneſſes are two <hi>Judaical</hi> Prophetick Reformers, Reforming Powers (Movers and Mourners for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) myſtically underſtood. (3) That the Spirit of Prophecy ſpeaks of them and characterizes them <hi>ſtilo Judaico,</hi> as the two Olive-trees, two Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, of <hi>Elias</hi>-like zeal and terrour, and <hi>Elias</hi>-like and <hi>Moſaick</hi> Wonder-working Power. (4) That the cauſe of their mourning is the deſolation of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the holy City being trodden under foot. (5) They are bipartite or of a twofold nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and therefore repreſented by two Witneſſes. (6) It is rational to think that the Beaſt (the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horned Beaſt the ſecular Power) ſhould kill them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the commencement of his Reign to rid the World of ſuch troubleſom Fellows.</p>
               <p>But then the following <hi>Particulars</hi> ſeem to be as rational. (1) The Text ſets down things as they were repreſented <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and leaveth us to ſpell
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:34043:193"/>out the things ſignified correſponding to the Viſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Repreſentations or Iconiſms; and though the <hi>Rind</hi> and <hi>Pulp</hi> muſt not be <hi>confounded,</hi> yet they muſt be <hi>connex, correſpondent</hi> and go <hi>hand in hand.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (2) it ſhould ſeem that the Witneſſes prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying, upon their death, quite ceaſeth, for <hi>mortui nihil agunt.</hi> (3) That upon this account the Nations rejoice and ſend gifts becauſe they are rid of them and their Teſtimony. (4) That therefore they had been tormented by them and their Teſtimony for a long time before they were rid of them by their Death. And (5) That the Beaſt himſelf was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and enraged by their long continued Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony before he ſets upon them to ſlaughter them. And (6) That during the time of their Prophecy they could not be dead in the ſenſe of the Prophecy, becauſe during that time they were as Olive-trees and Candleſticks ſtanding before God, and had and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed all their Wonder-working Power mentioned <hi>Ch.</hi> 11.5, 6. And (7) That their death in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is repreſented as an effect and conſequent of their prophetick Teſtimony, ſo long continued to the Prejudice of the World. Theſe, Sir, are the beſt Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that I can make againſt your Method of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting this Prophecy, which ſurely is deſirable it ſhould be true. But I cannot make all ends meet, which poſſibly you may do. But I intreat you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Sir, How it is poſſible that the Witneſſes ſhould be as <hi>dead Carcaſſes,</hi> and yet be <hi>in Action</hi> all the while? For if they be but <hi>Politically</hi> dead, they muſt by the Text be as <hi>Politically</hi> dead: If I could ſolve ſuch Objections, the Riſing of the Witneſſes ſounds ſo like the <hi>Reformation,</hi> that it would go down with me without chewing: but I have tryed ſeveral Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:34043:194"/>of reconciling things, but none of them will do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſix firſt Particulars repreſent truly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough the <hi>Cortical</hi> meaning of the Prophecy. But as to the latter part of the firſt of the following ſeven Particulars, where it is required that the <hi>Rind</hi> and the <hi>Pulp,</hi> though they be not to be <hi>confounded,</hi> yet that they be <hi>connex, correſpondent</hi> and <hi>go hand in hand,</hi> what the ingenious Objector would have by <hi>connex</hi> and <hi>going hand in hand</hi> I do not ſo well know, but that there is a parallel <hi>correſpondency</hi> I not only allow but aſſert. And I ſay that their <hi>Political</hi> Death, that is to ſay, their <hi>Inability</hi> of reforming things amiſs in the Church and Religion, this <hi>PITH</hi> runs parallel with the <hi>RIND, viz.</hi> with their lying three days and an half as <hi>dead Carcaſſes</hi> in the ſtreet of the City. And thoſe three <hi>days</hi> and an half (<hi>viz.</hi> three times and an half) the <hi>RIND,</hi> again run parallel with the <hi>years</hi> (the <hi>PITH</hi>) that they are in this Death <hi>Political.</hi> And what more exact Correſpondency can be required? But while they are thus dead as to <hi>Political</hi> power, it does not at all imply that they are ſo to power <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Prophetical,</hi> which they may exerciſe, though at their peril, and ſo in <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals</hi> be naturally killed alſo, though the Prophetick body or ſucceſſion continue, upon occaſions prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying, and thereupon perſecuted or ſuffering <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,</hi> &amp;c. from whence appears the invalidity of the ſecond Particular. For though the Witneſſes be <hi>politically</hi> dead, yet they are not ſo to <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Power and Prophecy. And <hi>mortui nihil agunt</hi> reaches no further than to what they are dead to. Otherwiſe the Souls of men departed would be aſleep; who, though they be dead to the things of this life, yet
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:34043:194"/>they are alive to the things of the other. And as for the third, fourth and fifth <hi>Particulars,</hi> their invalidity will be diſcovered, if we conſider the Prophetick Stile how <hi>Henopoetick</hi> it is, repreſenting frequently <hi>repeated Acts,</hi> as it were but <hi>one ſingle Act,</hi> whereby notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there is underſtood as well <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of <hi>Acts</hi> as <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of <hi>Perſons</hi> under one <hi>ſingle Beaſt</hi> and theſe two <hi>ſingle Witneſſes.</hi> Wherefore the Inhabiters of the Earth ſending gifts to each other upon the ſlaughter of the Witneſſes, is the <hi>RIND</hi> in this part of the Viſion, but the <hi>P<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LP</hi> is a ſucceſſive or repeated rejoicing of the earthly minded Church and enjoying the World in keeping down theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes the true <hi>Evangelici,</hi> and outing them of all <hi>Political Power</hi> in Church or State, and ſometimes of their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes,</hi> and in the mean time ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the World amongſt themſelves, and rejoicing therein. Wherefore the third Particular has no force againſt our Expoſition of the Viſion, if we conſider the nature of a Prophetick <hi>Henopoeia,</hi> that embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes the <hi>RIND</hi> of the Prophecy. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration deſtroys alſo all the force of the fourth and fifth Particulars. For there was a ſucceſſive <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical</hi> (and ſometimes Natural) death inflicted on the Witneſſes in a manner all along the three days or three times and an half or twelve hundred and ſixty Prophetical days. There was <hi>tormenting</hi> with their Teſtimony and ſuffering a <hi>political</hi> Death, at leaſt in a large ſenſe, for their Teſtimony and rejoicing at their ſuffering all along in a manner, nor was the Beaſt any long time provoked till he took his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in ſome degree or other. Theſe are intangling Inferences from the blending or confounding the <hi>Pulp</hi> with the <hi>Rind.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:34043:195"/>
               <p>And to the ſixth I ſay, That during the time of their Prophecy they might be <hi>dead</hi> according to that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Prophecy intimates them to be ſo, namely, <hi>politically,</hi> as having no power or ſtroke to reform things amiſs in the Church and God's Worſhip, and yet in the mean time, though at their own peril, might propheſie and teſtifie againſt the miſcarriage of things, and might in that ſenſe which is intended, be <hi>Olive-trees, Candleſticks,</hi> and in a myſtical ſenſe do ſuch Wonders as relate to <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> methinks there is no difficulty at all in this. And now to the laſt, Their <hi>political</hi> Death, and ſometimes being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred, is an effect of their Prophetick Teſtimony, but both the <hi>Cauſe</hi> and the <hi>Effect</hi> is <hi>ſucceſſional</hi> through many Ages, and one did not begin conſiderably la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the other, their <hi>political Death</hi> later than their <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> but went on continuedly and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly</hi> in a manner hand in hand, though by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick <hi>Henopoeia</hi> in the <hi>Rind</hi> the <hi>Death</hi> ſeems infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at the end only and at once. Wherefore if the Objector conſider well what is ſaid hitherto, he will eaſily find it poſſible that the Witneſſes ſhould be as <hi>dead Carcaſſes,</hi> as to any <hi>political Power</hi> or <hi>Efficacy,</hi> and yet as to <hi>another life</hi> (of Spirit and Prophecy) as occaſion required, be in action all the while they were <hi>politically</hi> dead, and lay as <hi>Carcaſſes</hi> in the ſtreet: As a man may be dead as to this World, but alive to the other, according as I noted above. If we but heed not to confound the <hi>Pith</hi> and the <hi>Rind,</hi> theſe things will appear as clear as the Sun. Conſider the latter part of Chapter the twenty ſixth, where we define what is the fulleſt and largeſt ſenſe of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes <hi>political Death.</hi>

But the <hi>eternal</hi> Generation of the Son was acknowledged (begotten of the Father before all Worlds, as the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed has it) and <hi>Arius</hi> expreſſing himſelf more compliantly with this Creed, was re-admitted into the Church by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Ten-horned Beaſt, <hi>v.</hi> 1. was like a Leopard, and Re-paganized <hi>v.</hi> 2. and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently was an Image of the Pagan Draconick Beaſt <hi>before</hi> the Image, <hi>v.</hi> 14. was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this therefore we are both agreed, That the <hi>Ten-horned Beaſt</hi> deſcribed in the fore-part of the Chapter, is indeed a <hi>lively Image</hi> of the <hi>Pagan Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conick Beaſt.</hi> But I deny that this Image was before that Image mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 14. but it is the very <hi>ſame Image,</hi> of which afterwards an account is given <hi>how</hi> it became ſuch, namely, that the <hi>Artificer</hi> was the <hi>two-horned Beaſt,</hi> and this the <hi>Effect</hi> and <hi>Object</hi> of his <hi>Art,</hi> ſo that the Method is eaſie and warrantable according to that general Analyſe which I did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. For the <hi>Ten-borned Beaſt</hi> being indeed ſo <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> an <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>old Pagan Draconick Empire,</hi> and here we finding in the ſecond part of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter an <hi>Artificer</hi> wonderfully skilful at <hi>making of Images,</hi> how naturally is it ſuggeſted that this is the <hi>Artificer</hi> that made that lively Image of the old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Empire repreſented in the ſore-part of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, and this the <hi>Magician</hi> indeed that raiſed this <hi>dead Beaſt</hi> to <hi>life</hi> again, conveighing a Spirit into him to the wonderment of the World.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. In theſe words [The Beaſt and his Image] Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſaith by the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is meant the <hi>two-horned Beaſt,</hi> and by his <hi>Image</hi> the <hi>Ten-horned Beaſt,</hi> who is ſaid to be the two-horned Beaſt his Image, becauſe <hi>he</hi> created him an <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Draconick</hi> Beaſt. But theſe words are but the ſame as to ſay [The Beaſt and the Image of the Beaſt] Now the word [Beaſt]
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:34043:204"/>in thoſe words. [The Image of the Beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.15.] does certainly ſignifie the Ten-horned Beaſt. (Compare the 14, and 15 Verſes) who being the firſt and of the moſt noble Extraction, is the fitteſt to be called the Beaſt demonſtratively, with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle prefixt: <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny that the Beaſt and his Image are the ſame that the Beaſt and the Image of the Beaſt, and that [Beaſt] in thoſe words [the Image of the Beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.15.] does ſignifie the <hi>Ten-horned Beast</hi> in this thirteenth Chapter. In thoſe words [The Beaſt and his Image] <hi>Beaſt</hi> there ſignifies the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beaſt, and his <hi>Image</hi> the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beaſt reſtored by him: But [Beaſt] in thoſe words [The Image of the Beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.15.] ſignifies the <hi>red Dragon</hi> that had his deadly wound in his fight with <hi>Michael,</hi> which wound the two-horned Beaſt healed.

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Elſe the expreſſion would be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, if ſometimes by the Beaſt ſhould be meant one thing, and ſometimes another, like Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who ſometimes makes him <hi>Domitian,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſay there is no ſhifting in the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Chapter by Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> For by <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the words [the Image of the Beaſt] is always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the <hi>old Pagan Dragon,</hi> ſo that ſo harſh a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon was not here appoſite. But where [the Beaſt and his Image] occur in one contexture of ſpeech, there indeed the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſignifies the <hi>two-horned Beaſt,</hi> and his <hi>Image</hi> the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beaſt. This has Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> declared with unexceptionable Judgment and Solidity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſaith, that where the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is preſent together with the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> in the ſame conſtruction of words is not to be found. 2. But whereas he addeth; As if there the Appellation of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhould ſerve the turn, why ſhould that but <hi>ſerve the turn</hi> which is the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal?</hi> 3. I ſee not how this concludeth, that the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beaſt is the <hi>Image</hi> of the Beaſt, but rather the contrary. 4. For if it had been ſaid, The falſe Prophet and his Image, there might have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in that; but they never being mentioned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is a ſign they are for ſubſtance the ſame, or of very intimate Relation, as the Pope and his Clergy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We have diſtinguiſhed this Argument into its parts, and we ſhall anſwer accordingly. To the firſt therefore I ſay, That Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Obſervation is true, and I will add the reaſon how it comes thus to paſs, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe there are but <hi>two Polities</hi> in the <hi>Pagano-Chriſtian</hi> Empire, <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> and <hi>Secular,</hi> by <hi>Daniel</hi> reſembled to the <hi>Clay</hi> and the <hi>Iron,</hi> and to the <hi>ſeeing Horn,</hi> (which is the pretended <hi>Seer</hi> or <hi>Prophet</hi>) and to the <hi>Horns without eyes.</hi> Wherefore thoſe two being all, and the <hi>Prophet</hi> the <hi>ſeeing Horn,</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the <hi>ten Horns without eyes,</hi> there is no
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:34043:205"/>room for any third, which is neither of theſe, and therefore the <hi>Beaſt</hi> here is the <hi>Image of the Beaſt</hi> or <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beaſt reſtored, as the <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> the two-horned Beaſt. To the ſecond, Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſays, it <hi>ſerves the turn,</hi> Beaſt being a briefer expreſſion than the Image of the Beaſt, but they ſignifie the ſame thing, nor is one more principal than the other, as is apparent out of what I have anſwered to the ſecond Argument. To the third I ſay, That this doth conclude the ten-horned Beaſt to be the Image of the Beaſt, becauſe, as I ſaid before, there be but two Polities or Powers, <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> or <hi>Secular,</hi> and the <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> ſtanding for the <hi>one,</hi> it is plain the <hi>Beaſt</hi> muſt ſtand for the other, namely, the <hi>reſtored Ten-horned Beaſt,</hi> reſtored, I ſay, into the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of the Idolatry and Cruelty of the old Pagan Empire. And therefore that Secular Beaſt that ſynchronizes with the falſe Prophet being the <hi>Image,</hi> it is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to call him ſo, the thing inferring it ſelf. To the fourth and laſt part, That out of what has been ſaid, I ſay it is evident, that in the mentioning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the falſe Prophet and the Beaſt, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Image of the Beaſt, becauſe the Image of the Beaſt and the ten-horned Beaſt reſtored, are for ſubſtance, nay, are altogether the ſame, but not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and the Image of the Beaſt the ſame, as if the Pope was the Image of that Beaſt ſo made by his Clergy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. The Image is moſt properly the Image of that Beaſt to whom it was made, and whom it did reſemble, but the Image did reſemble the ten-horned Beaſt, as I have ſhewed before, and was made to him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.14. ſaying that they ſhould make an Image to the Beaſt which had the wound by the Sword and did live. 2. Therefore Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> is here
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:34043:206"/>conſtrained to make a great Ellipſis before the laſt Clauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> as if it had been ſaid, And they did ſo, and he lived. 3. Leſt the Clauſe ſhould refer to the cure of the wound, which makes againſt Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> as may appear from my firſt Argument. 4. But I diſprove this: Firſt, becauſe it is made his Character before <hi>v.</hi> 12. that his deadly wound was healed from <hi>v.</hi> 3. Secondly, becauſe the living of the Image is ſpoken of in the words immediately following. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if thoſe Copies which read, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be admitted, the matter is out of doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt part I anſwer, That the Image was not made to the Ten-horned reſtored Beaſt, but to the Ten-horned <hi>Dragon</hi> wounded and ſlain in his fight with <hi>Michael.</hi> For ſo it is plainly ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 14. that they ſhould make an Image to the Beaſt which had the wound with the Sword. Which for certain was the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Ten-horned reſtored Beaſt</hi> muſt be this Image the <hi>Two-horned</hi> Beaſt cauſed to be made. To the ſecond, That it is no great Ellipſis, or rather a very little one or none at all, the ſenſe being ſo obvious and plain as it is. That they ſhould make an Image to the Beaſt which had the wound by the Sword, And he lived. How na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and plain is the ſenſe (to have interpoſed, [and they did ſo] had been a ſuperfluous bungle, at leaſt it had been a breach in the <hi>Artifice</hi> of the <hi>Cortex,</hi> which is ſo framed, as to ſlur the heedleſs Reader.) <hi>And he lived,</hi> that is, He revived again in the living Image of himſelf. To the third, I ſay the Clauſe does refer to the cure of the wound, for it implies the reviving of the whole Beaſt. For ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And as for the firſt Argument, I have anſwered it above. And to the fourth part I
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:34043:206"/>anſwer, That none of thoſe Reaſons prove that the Ten-horned Beaſt was reſtored before the two-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Beaſt reſtored him in this living Image he made of the wounded Dragon. Where note by the bye, That there is no deſcription of the manner nor means of his Reſtauration, unleſs this be it. And it is in the 12. verſe, that his Reſtauration and Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that ſtate is compendiouſly, and as it were in the Summ repreſented. See my Paraphraſe on the Verſe. But as for the <hi>living of the Image</hi> being ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the words immediately following, if he refers to <hi>v.</hi> 15. the word there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we render <hi>Life,</hi> but it may be as well rendred <hi>Breath</hi> in reference to ſpeaking, which is a further degree and operation of life, and therefore rightly follows ſo cloſe to <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, if that Reading were admitted, it would do no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to Mr. <hi>Mede;</hi> but according to the richneſs of the expreſſion, ſometimes, of the Scripture, it would illuſtrate one thing by two Metaphors at once, and ſo the Two-horned Beaſt would ſeem to do the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of both a <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> and <hi>Conjurer</hi> at once; of a Chirurgeon in <hi>healing</hi> the deadly wound of the <hi>Sword,</hi> of a <hi>Magician</hi> or <hi>Conjurer</hi> in making the <hi>dead Dragon</hi> appear <hi>alive</hi> in a <hi>breathing</hi> and <hi>ſpeaking Image.</hi>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. Laſtly, Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> argues very well, That of the ſelf-ſame is the Image of the Beaſt ſaid to be of whom is the <hi>Name</hi> and the <hi>Number, Chap.</hi> 15.2. But I ſay the <hi>Name</hi> and the <hi>Number</hi> is of the <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horned</hi> Beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.18. See the Context and the following Note. 2. And his Number is 666. The chief meaning muſt of neceſſity be <hi>Six</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Twelve,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Number, becauſe of the <hi>ſix Idolatrous Heads,</hi> of which the ſixth bears the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:34043:207"/>Whore; which I prove thus: The Empire was not totally deſtroy'd by the <hi>Oſtrogoths,</hi> but only wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Who can doubt but the Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> is the ſame now that it was before <hi>Cromwell?</hi> Or thus, 3. The Head that was cured bears the Whore, this none will deny; but the Head that was wounded is the ſame with that which was cured. For it is unreaſonable to give one man a Cut upon the Head, and lay a plaſter on another mans head. Therefore the Head that was wounded, that is the ſixth Head, or that of Emperours bears the Whore. 4. Note, That 144000 is not a ſquare, but a multiplication of 12, and ſo is 666 of ſix. And ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.1. where <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image, which was <hi>undoubtedly</hi> a Type of this, was ſixty Cubits high, and ſix broad; And it falls out handſomly, that the <hi>Apoſtatical</hi> Number ſhould be half of the <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> becauſe the Apoſtates had about the half of the Apoſtolical Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> they ſpoke half <hi>Canaan</hi> and half <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt I ſay, That the Context ſhows the Number to be the Number of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beaſt. For it is the Image of the Beaſt that cauſes all to receive, by his coercive power, the mark of the <hi>two-horned Beaſt.</hi> For of the two-horned Beaſt and the Image he made does all the ſecond part of the Chapter run. And therefore the Beaſt muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the <hi>Two-horned</hi> Beaſt, not of the <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horned</hi> Beaſt, and the Number to be his and the Image his, as the <hi>Artificer</hi> thereof. 2. To the ſecond, that I ſee no neceſſity of <hi>Six</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Twelve,</hi> it had been rather <hi>Seven, (viz.</hi> 777.) there being juſt <hi>ſeven Idolatrous</hi> Heads of the Beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1. or <hi>ſeven Idolatrous Kings, Chap.</hi> 17.10. and the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:34043:207"/>
                  <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> and <hi>Apoſtatical</hi> oppoſition alſo appearing under the <hi>ſeventh Head,</hi> the Whore riding the Beaſt under that ſame Head, not under the ſixth. Nor is the <hi>deadly Wound</hi> on the <hi>Head</hi> of the Beaſt by the <hi>Oſtrogoths,</hi> but by <hi>Michael</hi> in his fight with the <hi>red Dragon.</hi> He that does not ſee that, muſt be ſtark blind in <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Notions. To bring in the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrogoths</hi> here, is as if one ſtuffing a Pillow with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhould ſo forget himſelf, as to ſtodge in pieces of Brick or Clay. 3. To the third I ſay, It is a mere inelegant Quibble. <hi>Inelegant,</hi> in that it makes the <hi>Whore</hi> a Pail of Milk as it were born upon the Head of the Beaſt. A <hi>Quibble,</hi> in that he would have it as if one mans Head were cut, and another mans Head had the plaſter applied to it: whenas it is not one Beaſt's Head wounded, and another Beaſt's Head healed, but the Head of one and the ſame Beaſt is both wounded and healed. For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame individual</hi> Beaſt in ſucceſſion, ſo it is one and the ſame Head (or ſupreme Power) though under a <hi>ſevenfold Modification,</hi> and they are called ſeven Heads only in that reſpect. But one and the ſame Beaſt has ſtill one and the ſame Head, that is, his own Head, not the Head of another Beaſt, as this <hi>Quibble</hi> phanſies two Heads of two ſeveral men, one wounded, but the other plaiſtered. But the Beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. being repreſented with his Head healed, which <hi>ipſo facto</hi> is the <hi>ſeventh Modification</hi> of the Head, and that under which the Beaſt bears the Whore (which expreſſion implies it to be for ſubſtance the ſame Head) agrees well with that of <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. where the Beaſt is called the Beaſt <hi>that was, is not, and yet is:</hi> which imports that he is the <hi>ſame Beast,</hi> as the <hi>Head</hi> the <hi>ſame,</hi> but healed from
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:34043:208"/>its wound with the Scar of Chriſtianity upon it, though ſo groſly grown into Pagan-like Idolatries. Whence it is plain, the Number 666 has no refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beaſt reſtored, elſe it ſhould have been 777. Beſides, what wiſdom would there be in counting this Number? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. To the fourth; I grant that 144000 is made by 12 into 12000, and 666 by 6 into 111, but in the mean time it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable but that 144 <hi>Chiliarchies</hi> or <hi>Regiments,</hi> which have the nature of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nits</hi> in this caſe, and that 666 propounded <hi>alone,</hi> is to be numbred by extracting the ſquare Root thereof, neither 6 nor 111 being given to divide it by, nor both to produce it. And that one ſhould ſay that the Image that <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> ſet up was undoubtedly a <hi>Type</hi> of this, ſeems a piece of ſuch Levity as hugely misbecomes any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Interpreter of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> Nor is there any handſomneſs in <hi>ſix,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtatick</hi> Number being half of <hi>twelve</hi> the <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Number. For the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statick</hi> Church, if you compare the <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of it with themſelves, it has all of them; but if with <hi>Apostatick</hi> or corrupt Doctrines, the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is not the tenth part of the Apoſtatick. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the weakneſs of all theſe Arguments, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the Pope ſhould be the Image of the <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horned</hi> Beaſt reſtored, the Popes being <hi>ſingle</hi> Perſons, but the <hi>Ten-horned Beaſt,</hi> a Body <hi>Politick.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XLII. <hi>Nine Arguments out of</hi> Socinians <hi>and other</hi> Sectaries, <hi>whereby they would prove the first</hi> Imperial <hi>Council,</hi> Anno Dom. 326. <hi>to be the</hi> Epocha <hi>of the time of the Witneſſes till their Riſing. With Anſwers to each Argument.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN <hi>Arithmetica Apocalyptica</hi> upon the third Query I have fixt and ſetled the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Apoſtaſie with all care and circumſpection I could, and there, I hope, upon very good grounds concluded, That the true and preciſe <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Apoſtaſie of the mournful Witneſſes, and indeed of all the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> is to be pitched in the year of our Lord 393. Wherefore we are concerned to anſwer theſe nine Arguments that would infer it to be in the year 326. which are as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The firſt <hi>Imperial</hi> Council made the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire a <hi>National</hi> Church, and ſo moſt fit to be called a <hi>Beast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church under their Kings was a <hi>National</hi> Church, and yet no <hi>Beast. Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> make the Beaſt, not one publick <hi>National</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith. It is againſt the very Light and Law of Nature that the Supreme Power in any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould not look after Religion, and make Laws and Orders concerning it, ſo far as conſiſts with the <hi>juſt</hi> Liberties of <hi>truly conſcientious</hi> men, nor are <hi>repugnant</hi> to the <hi>written Law of God,</hi> whether in <hi>Scripture</hi> or in <hi>Humane Souls.</hi> This is ſo conſiſtent with Chriſtianity, that I do not doubt but the Holy
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:34043:209"/>City in the <hi>Millennium</hi> will be built by a Council <hi>truly Holy,</hi> and <hi>truly Oecumenical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. This <hi>Imperial</hi> Council confeſſedly <hi>added</hi> to the <hi>Creed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> concluded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt and <hi>Triunity</hi> of the Godhead, was no <hi>addition</hi> to the <hi>Creed</hi> or Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scripture, but only an Explication made for the <hi>quieting</hi> of the Church, and burying that Floud of Contention wherewith the <hi>Dragon</hi> would have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed the Church. And therefore no Pride, Fraud, nor Covetouſneſs being underneath, but a ſincere ſtudy of preſerving the Church in Peace, and of exhibiting ſuch a Form of Faith as was leaſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the Cavils of the Heathen, as if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians worſhipped <hi>more</hi> Gods than <hi>one,</hi> or any thing that was <hi>not God,</hi> we have no reaſon to queſtion but Chriſt aſſiſted and directed that Council in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations according to his promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. That this Council has been of <hi>greatest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and moſt <hi>dangerous</hi> to be oppoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do not ſee how this derogates any thing from the worthineſs of the Council, ſo that it ſhould be made the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the time of the mournful Witneſſes till their Riſing. Certainly it is as <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> to oppoſe the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> and yet I think no man will deem it a fit <hi>Epocha</hi> for the time of the mournful Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The Council of <hi>Nice</hi> ſet the <hi>first Horn</hi> on the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Beaſt,</hi> the other not by full Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity till <hi>Anno</hi> 380. or rather 451. A Beaſt may be a Beaſt without one Horn, or with none; but he cannot have an Horn and be no Beaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Patriarchate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that other
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:34043:209"/>of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that they be the <hi>two Horns</hi> of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beaſt, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. I eaſily admit. But ſo ſoon as they were <hi>two Summities</hi> or <hi>Preeminences Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical,</hi> that they were neceſſarily <hi>ipſo facto two Horns</hi> in that worſe ſenſe, that I deny. For neither embodying into a <hi>Polity,</hi> or having <hi>Superiorities</hi> and <hi>Preeminences</hi> make <hi>Beasts</hi> and <hi>Horns,</hi> but only <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> and <hi>Cruelty.</hi> But the degeneracy of the Church into <hi>Idolatry</hi> was a pretty while after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. It commenced with the Beaſt <hi>that was, is not, and yet is.</hi> And he commenced with the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Empire into ſeveral Kingdoms, which was after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and the firſt <hi>Conſtantinopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. The Dragon ſtood before the Woman that was ready to be delivered, to devour the Child as ſoon as it was born, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.4. The Child was born in the <hi>Converſion</hi> of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Re-paganizing</hi> of the Church muſt be preſently after, and ſo was the flight of the Woman into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Dragon</hi> ſtood ready to devour the Child ſo ſoon as it was born, but no Text ſays <hi>he did devour</hi> it ſo ſoon as it was born, but quite contrary, that it was caught up to the Throne of God, and poſſeſſed the <hi>Imperial</hi> Crown, and the Woman alſo eſcaped by her flight into the Wilderneſs. An <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> does not at all infer an effect. I underſtand no force at all in this Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. This gives a good account of the univerſal Woe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.12. which ſeems to come in ſtrangely after thoſe words of Triumph preceding. For the Devils Pagan Worſhip muſt quickly have come to an end by the Converſion of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> if he could not
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:34043:210"/>in that ſhort time have turned off <hi>Conſtantine</hi> from the Faith or Re-paganized the Chriſtians. And the greatneſs of his wrath ſhows he was likely to make quick diſpatch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, (1) That that Wo is not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal; Earth and Sea not comprehending all the parts of a <hi>Political</hi> World. There are Heavens beſides that are bid to rejoice at this defeat by the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> The vulgar people are Earth and Sea, and amongſt them the Devil was reſolved to beſtir himſelf. (2) The ſhort time he had to turn himſelf in, is in reference to the keeping up his old <hi>Draconick</hi> Religion. He muſt either do it before the Woman go into the Wilderneſs, or elſe never. And therefore that floud of Contention was to turn off the Populacy from Chriſtianity, and make them adhere to the <hi>old Pagan</hi> Religion. But for Re-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizing the Empire become Chriſtian, his time was not ſhort for that; he carrying on and perfecting that project for many hundred years. (3) And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The greatneſs of his wrath only ſhows the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſtraits, not the quickneſs of his ſucceſs in thoſe deſigns of either upholding the old Paganiſm, or introducing a new one. In the former whereof he is quite defeated, and in perfecting the latter his progreſs was but ſlow when once begun, nor begun till about four hundred years after Chriſt, when the Empire begun to be broken into many Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. In this way we need not go to the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conjectures of proportion betwixt the <hi>inner</hi> and <hi>outer</hi> Court from <hi>Villalpandus,</hi> or arbitrarily fix on ſuch an <hi>Epocha</hi> as will beſt ſuit with our own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. For the ſtate and times of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> are ſignally diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:34043:210"/>of themſelves with reference to the <hi>Altar, Chap.</hi> 11.1. as the <hi>Symbol</hi> of Martyrdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſay, (1) That the proportion of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> and <hi>outer</hi> Court of the Temple, namely, the <hi>Area's</hi> of them in <hi>Villalpandus,</hi> are not uncertain. And it is the <hi>Area's</hi> of them by a <hi>Metonymia Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncti</hi> that are conceived to be meaſured. The ſquare <hi>Area</hi> of the whole Temple in the largeſt ſenſe is conceived to be caſt into nine ſquare <hi>Areolae</hi> of equal bigneſs. Two of which are the <hi>Area's</hi> of the <hi>inner</hi> Court, the reſt of the <hi>outer.</hi> Whence the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> to the <hi>outer</hi> is as two to ſeven. And it is <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi>'s Temple queſtionleſs that the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> alludes to, and none elſe: As the deſcription of the Trees and the River, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. is from thence. And the thing is ſo phraſed, according to the Artifice of the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Stile, that both the proportion of the <hi>Time</hi> of the Non-Apoſtaſie and Apoſtaſie, and alſo the Non-Apoſtate and Apoſtate <hi>Condition</hi> of the Church is inſinuated. For his being bid to meaſure the <hi>inner</hi> Court, ſhows the <hi>Symmetricalneſs</hi> of that State of the Church, but the rejecting the <hi>outer</hi> Court from being meaſured, intimateth its <hi>Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurableneſs</hi> or Aſymmetry to the Meaſure. But the naming the forty two months it was to be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down gives a third Term, whereby we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>time</hi> the Church was not yet trodden down by the Gentiles. For as the <hi>outer</hi> Court is to the <hi>inner,</hi> ſo is forty two months time to the Time ſought for, which is twelve months. Thus, As 7 to 2, ſo 42 to 12. The time therefore of the Non-Apoſtate Church is one entire Time or two Semi-times. (2) And this plainly hinders us from ſeeking ſuch an <hi>Epocha</hi> as will beſt ſuit with our own Opinions; this fixing the time
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:34043:211"/>to near about four hundred years after Chriſt. And <hi>Chemnitius</hi> who knew nothing of this, does place the Apoſtaſie of the Church about that time: which is a thing very conſiderable. And beſides, no man that underſtands himſelf in <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Notions, can fix the <hi>Apoſtatick Epocha</hi> where he pleaſes, the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe</hi> it ſelf having fixt it to the beginning of the healed <hi>Beaſt</hi> and of the Beaſt that was, is not, and yet is. Which begins with the breaking of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire into many Kingdoms, which breaking begun about the time aboveſaid. And then (3) and laſtly, Though there was indeed at <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a <hi>ſignal</hi> Change of Affairs in the Church, yet that was not the <hi>healing</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> but the <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferouſly wounding</hi> the <hi>Dragon,</hi> of which the Witneſſes did not complain, but of his <hi>healing</hi> again. And the mentioning the <hi>Altar</hi> does not imply that the Times of <hi>Martyrdom</hi> were the <hi>only Symmetral</hi> Times of the Church, but that the <hi>Symmetral</hi> Times of the Church did comprehend thoſe Times alſo. And though it was no long time, yet there was a time for the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth King</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to reign, before the Beaſt <hi>that was, is not, and yet is,</hi> was to come upon the Stage. Therefore theſe are two ſignal differences of Time noted in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> the <hi>Non-Apoſtaſie</hi> and <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> of the Church, from the <hi>entrance</hi> of the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of which the <hi>middle Synchronals</hi> are to commence, and not from the <hi>ceaſing</hi> of the <hi>Perſecutions</hi> by the <hi>Pagan Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. The <hi>Atrium</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Court without</hi> doth elegantly expreſs the place of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Throne, as the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <hi>Temple</hi> was the place of <hi>God's Throne</hi> in his Church which is his Temple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſee no Elegancy in making the <hi>outer</hi> Court
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:34043:211"/>the Imperial Throne, foraſmuch as the <hi>Atrium</hi> of the Temple was not the place of the Throne of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but a Porch which <hi>Solomon</hi> built in his own Houſe of the Foreſt of <hi>Lebanon</hi> for the Throne of Judgment, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.7. And beſides, the Church was not leſs <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or the <hi>Throne of God</hi> leſs in it for <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s being converted to Chriſtianity, or for his calling a general <hi>Council</hi> for the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Nor was he inferiour to any of the Biſhops for <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>moderation,</hi> that the Church ſhould be in a worſe condition for his being the Head thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. The laſt Argument is the Completion of the Prophecy ſo exactly, not only by <hi>Semi-times,</hi> but likewiſe by <hi>Months, Calvin</hi>'s improvement of the Reformation falling out in the two laſt months, or rather laſt month, and a greater light of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the laſt <hi>Decade,</hi> or laſt of the twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty days, which end in the Year 1586. when the <hi>Poland</hi> Reformers were in their prime, in that <hi>last Act</hi> oppoſing the <hi>firſt Act</hi> of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Beast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Completion ſhould be to a month or a day, is but a <hi>precarious</hi> Suppoſition. Beſides that we have demonſtrated to the contrary in <hi>Chap.</hi> 25. That not a <hi>Prophetical Day</hi> nor a <hi>Month,</hi> but a <hi>Semi-time,</hi> is the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> for computing the Time of the Event in the <hi>Medial Viſions.</hi> And being the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Witneſſes began with <hi>Luther, Anno</hi> 1517. and according to this <hi>Epocha</hi> is finiſhed <hi>Anno</hi> 1586. this yet is a demonſtration againſt the Oppoſer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that a month cannot be the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> of meaſuring this Event, the difference betwixt 1517. and 1586. being more than two Prophetical Months. And
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:34043:212"/>therefore much leſs can a <hi>Decade</hi> be the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite,</hi> the difference containing even almoſt ſeven Decads. And now for that which pretends to be the <hi>Cream</hi> of this ninth Argument, as if the Event of the Riſing of the Witneſſes were crowned and completed exactly in the <hi>Poland</hi> Reformers, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Socinians,</hi> in the laſt ſingle year of the 1260, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1586. to me it ſeems a ſtrong Argument againſt this <hi>Epocha</hi> of 326, when the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council ſate, it being not likely that Providence would countenance ſo groſs an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie with ſo accurate an Hit in the Event; An He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie that runs <hi>counter</hi> not only to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Church, but to <hi>plain Scripture it ſelf.</hi> For as for the Divinity of the <hi>Logos,</hi> it is manifeſtly ſet down in the beginning of S. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel: <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi> Nor can it be evaded by ſaying, the <hi>Word</hi> is <hi>God</hi> by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with <hi>God.</hi> For it is as ſenſleſs as if one ſhould conclude the <hi>Body</hi> a <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>united</hi> with the <hi>Soul</hi> that is a <hi>Spirit.</hi> And then for the Trinity, it is plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by our Saviour himſelf, in his commanding them to preach to all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And the firſt part of the Doxology, <hi>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> was in uſe in the Church before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, as you may ſee in <hi>Seth Calviſius.</hi> But this is not a place to inſiſt on theſe things. The <hi>Socinian</hi> is a very ſtrait-laced Gentleman, of a narrow Sphere, and unphiloſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Genius,</hi> of a maimed or depraved perception and inept to conceive any ſubſtance that is <hi>immaterial,</hi> and their Ring-leader <hi>Socinus</hi> ſo unfit for <hi>Theoſophy</hi> or <hi>Theology,</hi> that contrary to <hi>expreſs Scripture,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:34043:212"/>
                  <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>knowable</hi> by the <hi>Light of Nature:</hi> a fit Generation of men to <hi>conſummate</hi> the <hi>Reformation</hi> touching the deep Myſteries of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt and <hi>Triunity</hi> of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and to have their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority oppoſed to that of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. But (2) beſides this, the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> was not held <hi>Anno</hi> 326. but <hi>Anno</hi> 325. in the twentieth year of <hi>Conſtantine, Paulinus</hi> and <hi>Julianus</hi> being Conſuls. So that this accuracy to a ſingle year vaniſhes. (3) <hi>Socinus</hi> his ſetting foot in <hi>Poland</hi> was ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 1586. and the prevailing of the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſo as to be in their <hi>Acme</hi> or Prime there, a lubricous thing to determine to a year. (4) But <hi>Chriſtianus</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> reforms his Country juſt in the year 1586. and in the <hi>Orthodox</hi> way of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> &amp;c. which ſhows further the weakneſs of this laſt Argument. (5) If the 326. year after Chriſt were the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Riſing of the Witneſſes, it making the twelve hundred and ſixty days Prophetical reach but to the year 1586. it will fall ſhort of ſome <hi>Specimina</hi> of their <hi>Riſing,</hi> as that in <hi>Bohemia</hi> where <hi>Mattathias</hi> grants liberty of Religion in the year 1608. And laſtly, Whereas, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.28. there is promiſed to him that overcomes <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Prematurity</hi> and a ſurprizing or unexpected timelineſs of the Event; this <hi>Epocha</hi> caſts the beginning of the Event after almoſt two thirds of the laſt <hi>Semi-time</hi> or <hi>Hexamenon</hi> were expired. So inauſpicious an <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> every way is the 326. year of our Lord for the time of the Witneſſes till their Riſing.</p>

               <p>THE Text and Gloſs on <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>That was, is not, and yet is.</hi> The ſame Empire was before <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtulus,</hi> was not under the <hi>Oſtrogothian Kings,</hi> and was recovered again by <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> This Expoſition does not exclude an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> ſenſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Pagan, Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Re-paganized.</hi> But it is not ſo proper to ſubſtitute a Body <hi>myſtical</hi> or a <hi>Quality</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a <hi>Body Politick,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> was under the reſt of the Heads. And ſo for the Eccleſiaſtical ſenſe or pure <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the time of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> muſt be ſhort indeed, <hi>viz.</hi> confined to ſome part of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Reign. Nor do I ſee how Dr. <hi>More,</hi> according to his Sentiments, can well diſpoſe of the <hi>Arian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſay, (1) That the Beaſt <hi>that was, is not, and yet is,</hi> is the ſame that aſcends out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit, and whom the Inhabitants of the Earth ſhall <hi>wonder after, whoſe names are not writ in the Book of life.</hi> Which therefore plainly concerns <hi>Religion,</hi> not the <hi>Civil</hi> State. And beſides, it is the <hi>whole Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire (as appears by the <hi>Ten</hi> Horns, of which
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:34043:213"/>the <hi>Oſtrogothian</hi> Kings are one) in a new diſguiſe. (2) We cannot ſay under the <hi>Oſtrogothian</hi> Kings the Roman Ten-horned Empire was not, for it was then, as before <hi>Auguſtulus.</hi> Nor after the Recovery by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> that the Empire is not (as then) and yet is, <hi>viz.</hi> as to Civil Conſtitution, which the Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer aims at. For the Roman Laws and Magiſtrates were ſupported by the <hi>Oſtrogothian</hi> Kings, as you may ſee in <hi>Carolus Sigonius, De Imperio Occidentali, lib.</hi> 15, 16. (3) The true Expoſition does not only not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Eccleſiaſtical, but ſhows that it alone is the right meaning, this other being ſo exceeding weak and vain. For can it be ſaid of that Civil Recovery by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> that all the Inhabitants of the Earth, whoſe <hi>Names were not writ in the Book of life,</hi> would wonder after it, or after that Civil Beaſt of <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>'s Recovery? (4) The Eccleſiaſtick ſenſe does not put a <hi>Quality</hi> inſtead of a Body <hi>Politick,</hi> but ſhows the Qualifications of the <hi>Body Politick</hi> and the <hi>Head.</hi> And it is further obſervable. That the <hi>Red Dragon, quatenus</hi> wounded in the <hi>Head</hi> by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> was in the Gloſſer's ſenſe a <hi>Myſtical</hi> Body, that is, a <hi>Religious</hi> Body, <hi>Paganly</hi> Religious, and in <hi>that ſenſe</hi> wounded in his Fight with <hi>Michael,</hi> and in his <hi>Head myſtically</hi> alſo, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> turning <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Who therefore is that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a quite different King from the ſeven Kings that anſwer to the ſeven Heads of the Beaſt. (5) And this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> his time indeed is ſhort according to the Text. But I deny that it is confined to ſome time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Reign, but reaches to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Head of the Beaſt <hi>that was, is not, and yet is.</hi> Which is the Time of the Empire's Diviſion into ten Kingdoms. For they receive their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:34043:214"/>at the ſame hour with this Beaſt. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably plain, from which there is no ſubterfuge, and is an undeniable Teſtimony for the <hi>Symmetrical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the Church for about four hundred years after Chriſt. (6) Dr. <hi>More,</hi> according to his Sentiments, can diſpoſe very dextrouſly both of the <hi>Arians</hi> and of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate. For firſt for <hi>Julian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, his time was exceeding ſhort, ſo that after the deadly wound of the Pagan Head by <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Converſion, this little ſhort Reign of <hi>Julian</hi> a Pagan Emperour was but as it were a <hi>ſhort Throb</hi> or <hi>gaſp</hi> of the <hi>mortally</hi> wounded Head, after which it quite dyed, till it was healed by the Apoſtaſie into a kind of <hi>Pagano-Chriſtianiſm.</hi> (7) And laſtly, for the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperours, they kept this Head in death ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, in that they were <hi>zealous Chriſtians,</hi> not <hi>Pagans</hi> nor <hi>Pagano Chriſtians</hi> by worſhipping <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of thoſe Daemons or Saints. And as for that groſs <hi>Arianiſm</hi> (which when it was at groſſeſt, worſhipped no Object but what they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Maker of Heaven and of Earth) it was hufft off the Stage betimes. And none of theſe <hi>Arians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the firſt Chapter of S. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, where the Deity of the <hi>Logos</hi> was expreſly ſignified, only their weakneſs could not reach the full ſenſe of ſo deep a Myſtery, as it proved to them. And thoſe more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined <hi>Arians,</hi> how near they were to the Truth, or how near they might be underſtood to have come to the Truth, and that it might be proved to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a frabble of words than a diſtinct diſagreement of ſenſes, it were too operoſe a matter to declare here. How much ſome Fathers have cryed out againſt the <hi>over-much curioſity</hi> of Definitions by <hi>Councils,</hi> Hiſtory will teach us. See what is attempted <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.</p>

               <p>The Text and Gloſs on <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>And there are ſeven Kings.</hi> This is in effect to ſay, The ſeven Heads are ſeven Kings, and but ſeven Kings. That as the <hi>first Head</hi> is the <hi>firſt King,</hi> ſo is the <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſeven Heads indeed are ſeven Kings, that is, the ſeven Heads of the Beaſt are ſo, and alſo but ſeven Kings. And as the firſt Head is the firſt King that anſwers to that firſt Head of the Beaſt, ſo is the ſeventh Head of the Beaſt the <hi>ſeventh King</hi> that anſwers to the <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> of the <hi>Beast.</hi> But there being a time when the Empire was not Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and conſequently <hi>not a Beaſt,</hi> but having then alſo a <hi>King</hi> (or Head, but not of the <hi>Beaſt</hi>) the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> being a King, the <hi>ſeventh King</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire</hi> (though no King or Head of the Beaſt) and numbred expreſly in the Text in the <hi>ſeventh</hi> place, and the ſucceeding King called the <hi>eighth,</hi> it is manifeſt there are <hi>eight Kings,</hi> though but <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> of the Beaſt. What can be more plain?</p>
               <p>The Text and Gloſs upon <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>He is the eighth.</hi> He does <hi>not ſay</hi> the <hi>eighth King</hi> or Sovereign, but by reaſon of the ſixth Head reviving, he is as it were an eighth King or an eighth Head, but not otherwiſe. For there were but ſeven Heads and ſeven Kings: and that this Beaſt redivive was not the eighth King and ſeventh Head, as Dr. <hi>More ſaith,</hi> I have proved before. And it is further proved by the following words, <hi>viz.</hi> And is of the ſeven: which was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if he was not the ſeventh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You ſay he does not ſay the eighth King: (1) What does he ſay then? He ſays five Kings are fallen, one King is, and another is to come, which plainly is the ſeventh. And then he ſays, The Head
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:34043:215"/>of the Beaſt that was and is not, he is the eighth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Maſculine gender. If he be not the eighth King, what eighth is he? Or what can be ſaid more expreſly? Nay, the Text has it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. By which plainly is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that he is <hi>both</hi> the <hi>eighth King,</hi> and alſo <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>ſeven Kings repreſented</hi> by the <hi>ſeven Heads of the Beast,</hi> which are Idolatrous Heads. So diſtinct and exquiſite is this Prophetical Declaration. (2) This eighth King is the ſixth Head revived together with the Beaſt, that is, is the ſeventh Head of the Beaſt Re-paganizing. (3) But he is an <hi>eighth King,</hi> becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the <hi>ſeventh</hi> his immediate Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour.

(4) Nor has he proved before that the Head of the Beaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divive is not the eighth King and ſeventh Head, as appears from what has been ſaid above. (5) And for his laſt proof it is wondrous weak; as if, becauſe he is ſaid to be one of the <hi>ſeven Kings anſwering</hi> to the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the ſame with them, he may not be the eighth King in reſpect of the <hi>pure</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Caeſars,</hi> which were the <hi>ſeventh</hi> King of the Empire when it ceaſed to be a <hi>Beast.</hi> It is very Emphatical here to ſay, [and is one of the ſeven] it inſinuating this ſenſe, That though the <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>CHAP. XLIV. <hi>An Objection againſt the placing of the</hi> Epocha <hi>of the Apoſtaſie in the year</hi> 393. <hi>as from other</hi> Topicks, <hi>ſo from</hi> Rome<hi>'s not being till ſome hundreds of years la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſo, guilty of bloodſhed.

               <p>IN the laſt Chapter but one I anſwered nine Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby ſome <hi>Sectaries</hi> would prove that the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Time of the Witneſſes till their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is in the year 326. contrary to what we have determined in <hi>Arithmetica Apocalyptica,</hi> where from the proportion of the <hi>outer</hi> Court to the <hi>inner,</hi> we conclude the <hi>Epocha</hi> to be in the year 393. which is ſixty ſeven years later than the former <hi>Epocha.</hi> And yet there are thoſe that think it ſtill ſet much too high. For the complaint of the Witneſſes being tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> and the Apoſtaſie conſiſting main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of theſe two Parts, <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of Time do not agree with the truth of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.

So what ſhall be made of that Interval? <hi rend="sup">d</hi> And it was almoſt 400 years after that, in the end of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Century, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſhedding of blood. So to make an Apoſtaſie to begin ſo early, whoſe two chief Characters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not till many Ages after, ſeems not very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. This will ſeem a material Objection at firſt ſight. But we muſt premiſe ſome few things for the better clearing thereof. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That though it has pleaſed the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to intimate to us from the proportion of the <hi>outer</hi> Court to the <hi>inner</hi> the very year wherein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences the firſt Semi-time of the ſeven, yet it does not thence follow, that a year is the exact <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> in the <hi>Eventual</hi> meaſures of the <hi>Medial Viſions.</hi> We have demonſtrated that a <hi>Semi-time</hi> or <hi>Hexamenon</hi> is the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> in the <hi>Eventual</hi> meaſures of thoſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> point not at the <hi>final</hi> or <hi>conſummate</hi> Ruine of Antichriſt, but at a <hi>partial</hi> Ruine of him, there is but a <hi>partial</hi> Fall of the City <hi>Babylon</hi> at the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes, Apoc.</hi> 11.13. See <hi>Synopſis Prophetica,</hi> Book 2. c. 7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Reader is to remember, That by the <hi>two-horned Beaſt. Apoc.</hi> 13. and by the <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> riding the <hi>Ten-horned</hi> Beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. I do not underſtand the <hi>Papal</hi> Hierarchy preciſely, but the whole Sacerdotal Hierarchy at large, as well
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:34043:217"/>
                  <hi>Eaſtern</hi> as <hi>Weſtern,</hi> once lapſed into the Apoſtaſie. This is fully expreſſed by me in my Expoſition of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> as any one may ſee that will conſult it. The Viſions indeed at laſt pinch cloſeſt upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, but the greateſt part concerns the Apoſtatized Church and Empire, as well <hi>Oriental</hi> as <hi>Occidental.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> with which the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> begins, is an <hi>Hieratico-politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtico-ſecular</hi> Head, and it is hard to find the <hi>Secular</hi> acting in matters of Religion without ſome or other of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> countenancing the ſame. But whether one or both act at once from <hi>Apoſtatick</hi> Principles of <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Cruelty,</hi> it is a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Object of the mournful Teſtimony of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly, Where <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Government obtains, where <hi>Paganiſm</hi> is caſt out, where the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt and real <hi>Triunity</hi> of the Godhead profeſſed, though not to the utmoſt accuracy of <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi> yet ſo ſo far, as there is nothing worſhipped with Religious or Divine Worſhip, but what is juſtly conceived capable thereof, even from the very Teſtimony of Scripture: theſe men that thus profeſs and practiſe, are really and in truth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and their Church and Polity Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Having premiſed thus much, we will conſider the Objection in the main Particulars thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="sup">a</hi> The firſt is, That if the Apoſtaſie began in the year 393. it muſt have quite been ended in the year 1653. when the 1260 Prophetical days do expire. But we anſwer to this out of the ſecond Premiſs, That the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> point not at the <hi>final</hi> or conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:34043:218"/>Ruine of Antichriſt, but <hi>partial.</hi> The Time of the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> is the Time of the entireneſs of his Kingdom before it was broken or conſiderably dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="sup">b</hi> To the ſecond, That there was no conſiderable Mutation either after the year 393. or the year 1653. I ſay, the ſeeming force of this Objection is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a miſtake, as if the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> in the <hi>Eventual</hi> meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> were a Prophetick day or ſingle year, whenas it is a <hi>Semi-time</hi> or <hi>Hexamenon,</hi> according to the firſt Premiſs. Wherefore if conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Changes happened within the firſt Semi-time and in the laſt, it is ſufficient; As when the <hi>Eventual</hi> meaſure is by ſingle years, if the thing fall out that denominates the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Period of Time in the firſt year, and the Event in the laſt, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, though not in the firſt day or month, or in the laſt day or month of the year. If the <hi>Epochal Note</hi> ſhould fall out either before the beginning of the firſt Semi-time, or the <hi>predicted Event</hi> after the laſt, then indeed it would be a flaw; but if within the firſt and the laſt, and <hi>that</hi> in <hi>handſom</hi> proportion, then all is right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="sup">c</hi> To the third, That Idolatry came not into the Church till the beginning of the eighth Century. This ſeems a very odd Objection, as if there were no <hi>Idolatry</hi> but mere Image-worſhip, whenas certainly the <hi>Invocation</hi> of any <hi>inviſible created Powers, Saints</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> and to make them our <hi>Mahuzzim</hi> to put confidence in their Succour and Protection, is the <hi>Fundamental Idolatry</hi> upon which praying with eyes and hands lifted up to their Images, and other Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious or Idolatrous Rites done to them, are built. But that this kind of Idolatry began not long
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:34043:218"/>after the <hi>Epocha</hi> of 393. I have abundantly proved <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>

               <p>In the Year 428. or the ſixth day of the <hi>ſecond</hi> month of the firſt <hi>Hexamenon,</hi> that grandiſonant Speech was uttered by <hi>Nestorius</hi> upon his being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> unto the Emperour: <hi>Give me, O Emperour! the Earth cleared of Hereticks, and I will give thee Heaven; do thou aſſist me in rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hereticks, and I will ſuccour thee in vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Perſians.

               <p>In the twenty fourth day of the fourth month, or <hi>Anno</hi> 686. <hi>Funecius</hi> tells us, that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, inſtigated thereto by the Pope, compelled the people of <hi>Ravenna</hi> by ſlaughters, by beſieging their City, by deſpoiling them of their Goods, and by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and the like, to be ſubject to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and baniſhed <hi>Felix</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Ravenna</hi> to <hi>Pontus,</hi> having firſt deprived him of his ſight, as being guilty of their Revolt. The matter of Fact other Hiſtorians relate, as <hi>Nauclerus, Spondanus,</hi> and others; but <hi>Funecius</hi> ſeems to have committed a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachroniſm of twenty two years, or thereabout. It was according to <hi>Spondanus</hi> in the year 708. or the ſixteenth day of the fifth month of the <hi>ſecond Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the fourth day of the ſixth month, or <hi>Anno</hi> 726. or thereabout, in the Reign of <hi>Leo Iſaurus,</hi> the people in <hi>Italy,</hi> by the perſwaſion of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, was ſo zealous in the Cauſe of Images, that in <hi>Ravenna</hi> where the Imperial Authority moſt reſided, they flew into ſuch open Tumults and Rebellion, that they murthered <hi>Paulus</hi> the fourteenth <hi>Exarch,</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf they took <hi>Petrus</hi> the Duke, and put out his Eyes, and in <hi>Campania</hi> they beheaded the Duke <hi>Exhilaratus</hi> and his Son <hi>Adrian,</hi> who there took the Emperour's part againſt the Pope. See <hi>Hen. Foulis</hi> his Hiſtory, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>In the fifteenth day of the ſecond month of the <hi>third Hexamenon,</hi> or <hi>Anno</hi> 797. <hi>Irene</hi> unnaturally ordered her Son <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour his Eyes to be pulled out, which was acted with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon him, that he died preſently upon it. All Hiſtories ring of this Cruelty.</p>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:34043:224"/>
               <p>But I will not tire out my Reader. This is enough to prove that there was Violence and Cruelty uſed by the <hi>Hieratico-political</hi> Power of the Empire againſt the Orthodox many hundred years before the end of the eleventh Century. Nor will the brevity of this preſent Treatiſe of mine admit any large Excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions into Hiſtory. But we may be ſure that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox were held down by the hard rigour of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws againſt ſuch as ſhould utter any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Errours, be they what they will, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law, all along. Which could not but be a preſſure or oppreſſion, and ſomething akin to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Perſecution, which was erupturient all the while, and at laſt broke out in moſt ſalvage manner under the Papacy. The horrid effects whereof have hideouſly blackened the Hiſtory of that Church. Theſe are things ſo well known, that it is needleſs to beſtow a ſingle line upon them. I have done already enough, if not more than enough in Anſwer to the Objector's fourth and laſt Allegation.</p>

An Examination of this</hi> Hypotheſis, <hi>That it
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:34043:224"/>fails in the placing the</hi> Epocha <hi>of the</hi> 2300 Evening-Mornings. <hi>The</hi> firſt Collateral <hi>Line of ſeventy five years examined.

The right</hi> Epocha <hi>of the</hi> 2300 Evening-Mornings <hi>and of</hi> Daniel<hi>'s</hi> 1290 <hi>and</hi> 1335 <hi>days is to be fixt in</hi> Antiochus <hi>his Pollution of the Sanctuary.

               <p>THE ingenious Author of the <hi>Calendar</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Time,</hi> when he had carried on his <hi>Principal</hi> Line of <hi>Compute</hi> to the end of the ſeventy years Captivity, from which the Jews were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Cyrus</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 10.) which I am not concerned to examine, the next generally acknowledged Line of Time that occurred to his mind was the ſeventy Weeks of <hi>Daniel;</hi> but conſidering with himſelf that betwixt the ſeventy years ending, and ſeventy weeks beginning, there muſt be a middle ſpace of Time that is not to be void, he therefore to continue the <hi>Principal</hi> Line of his <hi>Calendar</hi> thorough that ſpace
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:34043:225"/>alſo, and ſuppoſing <hi>Daniel</hi> to receive the Viſion of the 2300 <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> at the cloſe of the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years Captivity, interprets theſe 2300 <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> to be ſo many Prophetical Days, <hi>viz.</hi> 2300 years, and places their <hi>Epocha</hi> at the expiration of the ſeventy years Captivity, namely, from the year wherein <hi>Daniel</hi> received the Viſion. And this <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> Line of Time he recommends to us upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral accounts, it reaching ſo handſomly from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Literal Babylon</hi> to the utter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Myſtical,</hi> from the rebuilding again of the <hi>Literal Jeruſalem</hi> to the raiſing of the <hi>New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem Myſtical,</hi> and for that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate or equal to ſeventy five years from its <hi>Epocha</hi> to the ſeventy Weeks; to the four hundred and ninety years of thoſe Weeks; to four hundred and four years from the Reſurrection of Chriſt to the Reign of the Beaſt; to his forty two months or twelve hundred and ſixty days Reign; to the thirty days that make <hi>Daniel</hi>'s twelve hundred and ninety days; and to forty five days, which added to the former number, make the thirteen hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five days of <hi>Daniel;</hi> the <hi>Principal</hi> Line two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> is commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or equal to all theſe <hi>Collateral</hi> Lines put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that the thirteen hundred and thirty five days reach as the two thouſand three hundred <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Mornings</hi> do to the utter deſtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> and the glory of the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi> This is to fall out in the Year 1772. <hi>viz.</hi> eighty eight years hence, upon the pouring out of the Vials begun in the Year 1727. the ſpace of their pouring out being the forty five days added to the twelve hundred and ninety days in <hi>Daniel;</hi> the beginning therefore of their
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:34043:225"/>pouring forth is forty three years hence. In the thirty, which added to the twelve hundred and ſixty, make <hi>Daniel</hi>'s twelve hundred and ninety days, are the ſeven Miniſterial Voices of the unſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeven Thunders uttered, which begin with the Sound of the ſeventh Trumpet (<hi>pag.</hi> 68.) and reach to the beginning of the Vials. The beginning of theſe thirty days is thirteen years hence upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the twelve hundred and ſixty days, when will be the complete Riſing of the Witneſſes, when the Papacy and Turkiſh Tyranny will be ſo broken, that the Witneſſes will univerſally put off their Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, they being rid of the oppreſſion of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors. And laſtly, the four hundred and four years is the time of the Purity of the Church, from the Reſurrection of Chriſt till the commencing of the forty two months of the Reign of the Beaſt or twelve hundred and ſixty days mournful condition of the Witneſſes. The contrivance is witty and inventive, as indeed the whole Book muſt be the effect of a mind notably much exerciſed in the ſtudy of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Prophecies, and eagerly ſet to find ſome grounds and hopes therefrom, that in a very ſhort time the oppreſſion of God's Church will be hugely abated or taken quite off from their ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>But let us now, and that very briefly, examine the grounds of theſe ſo great hopes, and how firm this frame and contrivance is. And firſt here he takes for granted, that the two thouſand three hundred <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> are ſo many <hi>years,</hi> though the Text ſays expreſly, That the Viſion of the Evening and Morning is <hi>true,</hi> that is, <hi>plain,</hi> not <hi>Aenigmatical,</hi> whence they muſt ſignifie ſo many <hi>days literally,</hi> not <hi>years.</hi> But becauſe ſeveral intelligent perſons have a
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:34043:226"/>propenſion to think theſe days may be <hi>alſo</hi> Typical of years, <hi>Antiochus</hi> being ſo notable a <hi>Type</hi> of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, I will not much gainſay the ingenious Author of the <hi>Calendar</hi> in this, but rather ſuppoſe that it is ſaid, that the Viſion of the Evening and Morning is <hi>true,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>plain,</hi> that the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe of the Prophecy may be as well aſſured as the <hi>myſtical</hi> and ſymbolical.</p>
               <p>But now in the ſecond place let us ſee how his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count will agree with approved Chronologers. Theſe two thouſand three hundred <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> end in the Year 1772. which is the 6485. year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period. Now count back from this year, the two thouſand three hundred <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> and their <hi>Epocha</hi> will be in the 4186. of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period; which, according to <hi>Helvicus,</hi> is the ſecond year of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> as alſo according to <hi>Seth Calviſius</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius,</hi> we may add alſo <hi>Thomas Lydiat.</hi> But the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> was exhibited to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> in the third year of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> who reigned fourteen years after that, as you may ſee in <hi>Thomas Lydiat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly therefore, The <hi>Epocha</hi> of the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> not being found in the year when <hi>Cyrus</hi> took <hi>Babylon,</hi> nor in the year after, when he gave the Jews leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into their own Country to rebuild the Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but five or ſix years after, and about twenty years after <hi>Daniel</hi>'s receiving the Viſion, that pretty Congruity of the two thouſand three hundred <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Mornings</hi> commencing with the deſtruction of the <hi>literal Babylon,</hi> and ending in the final deſolation of the <hi>Myſtical Babylon,</hi> (and ſo of the rebuilding the <hi>literal Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>myſtical</hi>) is quite ſpoiled.</p>
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:34043:226"/>
               <p>Fourthly, And as for the ſeventy five years com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing from the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Evening-Mornings,</hi> and reaching to the ſeventy Weeks, this firſt Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Line, as he manages the buſineſs, is rather the imagination of a Line than a real Line, as himſelf ſeems in a manner to confeſs (<hi>pag.</hi> 16.) For he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives it from juſt ſo many years as are named of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy in the Scriptures. Which is a <hi>pretty</hi> phancy, but <hi>precarious,</hi> to leave out the reſt of the years unmentioned, and the whole Reign of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> and <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis.</hi> Beſides, the one and twenty days of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s faſting, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.2. are drawn in to make up the Number, as if they were <hi>Prophetick</hi> days, whenas it is expreſly ſaid <hi>three weeks</hi> of <hi>days,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from <hi>Daniel</hi>'s ſeventy Weeks of <hi>years,</hi> which they ſignifie, the mention of days being not added to them; nor is it to be thought that <hi>Daniel</hi> faſted ſo for twenty one years together. But (<hi>pag.</hi> 17.) he attempts a more real Account of the ſeventy five years, which he will have commence with <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Monarchy, and end with the ſeventh of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus.</hi> But he differs in his Compute from <hi>Petavius</hi> by two years, from <hi>Calviſius</hi> by five, from <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Canon by ſix, and from <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi> by three years over: beſides that he places the beginning of the ſeventy Weeks in the ſeventh of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> whenas that <hi>Epocha</hi> is to be placed in the twentieth of his Reign, as. I hope, I have ſufficiently proved in the ſixteen firſt Chapters of this Book. Beſides that, we are to remember that the ending of the two thouſand three hundred <hi>Evening Mornings</hi> being, according to him, in the Year of our Lord 1772. that is, <hi>Anno Periodi Julianae</hi> 6485. reckoning thence backward the <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:34043:227"/>of the two thouſand three hundred <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> will be <hi>Anno Periodi Julianae</hi> 4186. that is, in the ſecond year of <hi>Cambyſes:</hi> which quite ſpoils this placing of the <hi>Epocha</hi> of this <hi>first Collateral</hi> Line ſeventy five in the beginning of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Monarchy. We paſs to the <hi>ſecond Collateral</hi> Line, the ſeventy Weeks of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly therefore, There ſeems to be a palpable flaw in that Line, foraſmuch as the ingenious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter is fain to lop off four days of the laſt Week of the ſeventy, and make them end (but with that defect) in the <hi>Reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> whenas that whole laſt Week is dedicated in the Prophecy to the making of a <hi>Covenant</hi> with many. And beſides, they are not ſeventy complete weeks, unleſs theſe four days be taken in, which are left out only to make the <hi>Collateral</hi> Lines juſt end with the principal Line of the two thouſand three hundred <hi>Evening-Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</hi> This therefore I conceive is a flaw in the Compute.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, As for the <hi>third Colluteral</hi> Line, four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and four, which begins in the year of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, and reaches to the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reign of the Beaſt, the forty two months or twelve hundred and ſixty days Prophetical. The pitching upon this number is admirably pretty and ſurpriſing: I mean the <hi>Invention</hi> thereof, <hi>pag.</hi> 43. of the Calendar, upon <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6.6. which is thus; (1) There is, ſays he, beſides the uſual Voice, <hi>Come and ſee,</hi> an extraordinary Note of Attention, not by, but to or in the midſt of the four living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>A meaſure of Wheat,</hi> &amp;c. to move extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Enquiry after the meaning. (2) By Enquiry into Hiſtory it fits none as <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> ſo juſt
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:34043:227"/>a Prince. (3) By Enquiry into the Time, he died two hundred and two years after our Lord's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which doubled reaches to the Empire torn on all ſides by the <hi>Barbarians</hi> and the Ten Kings Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. (4) By compare on our principal Line, four hundred and four years neither more nor leſs from the Reſurrection are neceſſary to adjuſt the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> to the laſt of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s thirteen hundred thirty five days. What then can we conclude but the Balances divide the Time as it were by exact weight one half againſt the other, and ſo exactly define the time of the Beaſt's Riſing, or of the beginning of his forty two months Reign? And again, <hi>pag.</hi> 83. in his <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> he ſays, the purity of the Church was weighed as it were in the Scales in the two hundred and ſecond year after the Reſurrection, or laſt year of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> and was found juſt at that time doublted, too light, <hi>viz.</hi> at the four hundred and four years end, or <hi>Anno vulgari</hi> 437. And what other account or meaning, ſays he, can be given of this place (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 6.6.) I deſire any one to give, I have not found its ſenſe yet attempted by any Interpreter.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this I grant, that <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> died <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 235. according to <hi>Petavius,</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no P. J.</hi> 4948. and conſequently that he died the year after the Reſurrection 202. But that that Voice in the midſt of the four Beaſts, <hi>A meaſure of wheat for a penny,</hi> &amp;c. was to raiſe our attention, and quicken our ſearch into any ſuch myſtical meaning of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances, as the Author would infer, I utterly deny, there being a pertinent ſenſe ſo plain and material that belongs to that Cry, and to the Balance in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that is, of a juſt and provident adminiſtration
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:34043:228"/>of affairs in the Empire under the third Seal, and the <hi>Voice</hi> in the midſt of the <hi>four Beaſts,</hi> is the <hi>Fame</hi> of it and Joy at it amongſt the <hi>People,</hi> who then had ſo juſt and careful Emperours over them, eſpecially <hi>Alexander Severus Mammeae F.</hi> This therefore only ſignifies the ſpecial Character of the third Seal, that the Church might compute their progreſs toward the ſixth, under which they were to have their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the Perſecutions of the Red Dragon. And to this ſenſe the ingenious Author of the <hi>Calendar</hi> might have read in Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> upon the place. To which we may add, If the ſaid Author had not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently torn off four days of the laſt week of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty, but begun this <hi>third Collateral</hi> Line at the end of the ſeventieth week, the two hundred and two years of this third Collateral Line would fall out four years after <hi>Severus</hi> his Death, ſo that this quaint de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of dividing this Line into two equal parts, weighed as it were in a pair of Scales, would be quite ſpoiled. But if beginning this third Line four years later, you will yet make the year of the Death of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> half the time thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> an hundred ninety eight, then will this <hi>Collateral</hi> Line fall four years ſhort of ſuch an <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Reign of the Beaſt, as from whence <hi>Daniel</hi>'s thirteen hundred thirty five days may expire with the two thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Evening-Mornings.</hi> So that this third <hi>Collateral</hi> Line, as it is framed, does but unjuſtly enjoy the fruit of the violence done to the ſeventieth week, which is a ſore blemiſh derived not only upon it, but the reſidue of the Collateral Lines. The weighing alſo of the purity of the Church two hundred and two years before it could be juſtly pronounced light upon the Balance and rejectaneous, has ſomething
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:34043:228"/>of harſhneſs in it. Wherefore we ſee there is no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Reaſon to leave Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s way of computing the ſpace of the pure State of the Church from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the <hi>outer</hi> Court to the <hi>inner,</hi> and betake our ſelves to this, though otherwiſe <hi>witty,</hi> yet <hi>lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous</hi> and groundleſs device of the Balance.</p>
               <p>Seventhly therefore I conceive, That the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> of the Church or <hi>Reign</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which is the beginning of this <hi>fourth</hi> Collateral Line, is not rightly fixed, the grounds thereof thus failing: There is ſome forty four years difference betwixt it and the true <hi>Epocha</hi> collected by the true Method of the proportion of the <hi>outer</hi> Court to the <hi>inner,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which this <hi>fourth</hi> Collateral Line, or twelve hundred and ſixty days expired above thirty years ago.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, This fifth Collateral Line thirty, which added to the former twelve hundred and ſixty days, makes <hi>Daniel</hi>'s twelve hundred and ninety days, this alſo is already expired, without any ſuch ſeven <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Voices</hi> of the ſeven unſealed <hi>Thunders</hi> that any one could diſcern. Which ſeven <hi>Voices</hi> of the <hi>Thunders</hi> are connex with the Thunders <hi>themſelves.</hi> And that the <hi>Thunders</hi> occupy the ſpace of the whole ſeventh Trumpet, I have irrefutably demonſtrated in more places than one. See the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>S. E.</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker</hi> on <hi>Apoc. Chap.</hi> 10. Wherefore the <hi>Voices</hi> of the <hi>Thunders</hi> being ſtretched from the beginning to the end of the ſeventh Trumpet, how can they be compreſſed into the ſpace of 30 years? Beſides that, <hi>Calend. pag.</hi> 68, 69. the ſeven <hi>Miniſterial Voices</hi> there pitched upon cannot belong to the <hi>Collateral</hi> Line of thirty after the twelve hundred and ſixty. For that Song of the 144000 is the deſcription of the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelici</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:34043:229"/>all along the <hi>ſix Trumpets.</hi> The Angel Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel</hi> reſpects the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>ſixth Wo-Trumpets,</hi> ſo that his Voice cannot be the ſecond, as being not come to the ſeventh Trumpet. And the <hi>Voice</hi> that declares the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that it is fallen, is alſo before the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coincident with the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> But the Author of the <hi>Calendar</hi> makes his <hi>Collateral</hi> Line of thirty years <hi>commence</hi> with the beginning of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> and to end before the pouring out of the Vials. But the four next <hi>Voices,</hi> as he would have them, do plainly fall into the time of the Vials, as is ſufficiently proved in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Remarker</hi> on the Apology. So that this Conceit of the ſeven <hi>Miniſterial Voices</hi> antecedent to the ſeven Vials is, as I conceive, quite out of doors.</p>
               <p>And now ninthly and laſtly, His ſixth and laſt Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral Line, which added to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s 1290 days, makes his 1335 days, which expire with the 2300 <hi>Evening-Mornings,</hi> this laſt <hi>Collateral</hi> Line of forty five days, eſpecially if the Reign of the Beaſt were reckoned from the right <hi>Epocha,</hi> ſeems too ſhort a time for the ſeven Vials to diſcharge themſelves in. For then all thoſe great things which the Vials por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, would be accompliſhed within theſe forty years, or thereabout, which to cooler and calmer Spirits muſt ſeem a thing <hi>incredible.</hi> His Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the four laſt Vials, <hi>pag.</hi> 70, 71. is correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough to Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> and for ought I know credibly true. But the three firſt Vials which he conceives yet to come, their fulfilling has been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly already. Nor is the firſt Vial a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the loathſomneſs of the marked Slaves of the Beaſt, but of their <hi>dementative</hi> Anger and Rage, of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:34043:229"/>
                  <hi>this</hi> thoſe <hi>angry Boils</hi> are a <hi>Symbol,</hi> ſo obvious, that ſcarce any Interpreters miſs of it, and it plainly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to, [And the Nations were angry] <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.18. Which paſſage (as is demonſtrated in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Remarker</hi> on the Apology) reſpects the times of the <hi>Vials.</hi> And for the ſecond Vial, it is not the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navigableneſs</hi> of the <hi>blood</hi> of a dead man (for ſo much blood as to ſail upon is a monſtrous Phancy hugely out of the way) but it is the <hi>dead fiſhes</hi> there that are intimated, wherein the ſtreſs of the <hi>Symbol</hi> lies. And <hi>Artemidorus</hi> tells us, that <hi>dead fiſhes</hi> in the <hi>Sea</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie diſappointment of hope, which came to paſs to the <hi>Pontifician Fiſhermen</hi> after the full ſettlement of the Reformation in the Kingdoms cut quite off from the Pope, and grown as cold as the <hi>Cruor</hi> of a dead man, to her Idolatries and Superſtitions. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the third Vial, that he interprets Rivers, of <hi>Aquaeducts</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi> rather than of <hi>Emiſſary</hi> Agents from the <hi>Roman</hi> See, no man will ſee Reaſon who conſiders what I have wrote in my <hi>Alphabet</hi> of <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſms,</hi> in the Iconiſm [River]. But however the fulfilling of theſe three firſt Vials has been already ſince the Riſing of the Witneſſes in the Reformation, whenas the Author of the <hi>Calendar</hi> phanſies them yet to come, which is no ſlight evidence againſt his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</p>
               <p>But now beſides all theſe Allegations againſt his ſix <hi>Collateral</hi> Lines, the ſixing of the <hi>Epocha</hi> of his <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> Line the two thouſand three hundred <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> in the year when <hi>Daniel</hi> received that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>viz.</hi> in the third year of <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> (as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no more than three years is mentioned of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> in Scripture, he was ſlain in that very year, and then <hi>Babylon</hi> taken, that ſo the two thouſand

But as for the <hi>mere Viſionary Exhibition,</hi> it was ſo far from reaching to the 2300 days, whether <hi>vulgar</hi> or <hi>prophetical,</hi> that it is not likely to have taken up <hi>one ſingle hour.</hi>

               <p>And beſides the <hi>Object</hi> of the <hi>Viſion</hi> which is the <hi>taking away the daily Sacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. not commencing before <hi>Antiochus</hi> his time as the <hi>Type,</hi> or <hi>Antichriſt's</hi> time as the <hi>Antitype,</hi> it is impoſſible the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the two thouſand three hundred <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> ſhould be placed ſo <hi>high</hi> as the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Nor is the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Viſionary Exhibition</hi> inquired into, but the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>taking away</hi> the <hi>daily Sacrifice,</hi> the tranſgreſſion that makes deſolate, and the giving the Sanctuary and the Hoſt to be trodden under foot. Unto <hi>this</hi> queſtion of the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>theſe</hi> things it is anſwered, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto</hi> 2300 <hi>days then ſhall the Sanctuary be cleanſed.</hi> So plain is it that the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the 2300 <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> cannot be fixt higher than from the violation of the Temple by <hi>Antiochus:</hi> Though there may be a pretence indeed in the <hi>Typical</hi> ſenſe of placing it <hi>lower, viz.</hi> in the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>myſtical An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus:</hi> which, according to my <hi>Epocha</hi> of his <hi>Reign,</hi> is the year 393. And therefore if you add the 2300 days Prophetical to 392 years, it will be the year of our Lord 2692. before the Sanctuary be cleanſed, a thouſand and odd years hence. But if you take the Author's <hi>Epocha,</hi> it will be above forty years more. So improbable is it that the <hi>beginning</hi> of the Reign of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> of whom <hi>Antiochus</hi> was a <hi>Type,</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the 2300 <hi>Evening-Mornings.</hi> Wherefore if they be Typical as well as <hi>Antiochus;</hi> as the Term of the 2300 days <hi>literal,</hi> from the firſt violation of the Temple, ſhows when the Sanctuary ſhould be cleanſed from <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Pollutions; ſo the end of 2300 Prophetical days from the ſame <hi>Epocha,</hi> ſhows when the Church of Chriſt will be quite purged from the Pollutions of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:34043:231"/>Antichriſt. And according to this middle or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate placing of the <hi>Epocha,</hi> it will be about four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years till the univerſal cleanſing of the Church from Antichriſtian Pollutions; till which, there being ſo ample a ſpace of time from the Riſing of the Witneſſes or commencement of the ſeventh Trumpet, it is a plain indication how much the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Calendar</hi> is out, in allotting but forty five years to the Effuſion of the ſeven Vials.</p>
               <p>And as it is thus demonſtrable by Reaſon, that the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the 2300 <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> is to be fixt in the Pollution of the Temple by <hi>Antiochus</hi> in the <hi>Typical</hi> ſenſe of them: So is it expreſly declared, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11. that there likewiſe is to be fixt the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocha</hi> of the 1290 days and the 1335 days. So that this quaint and wittily contrived frame of the <hi>ſix Collateral Lines,</hi> ſo artificially adjuſted to the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> Line of the 2300 <hi>Evening-Mornings,</hi> is every way utterly broken in pieces; as alſo any hopes from <hi>hence</hi> that the <hi>Papacy</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tyranny will be brought ſo low about twelve years hence, that the Witneſſes every where will put off their Sack-cloth, and cloath themſelves with the garments of gladneſs: Or that the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> will appear upon Earth about eighty eight years hence; Not the leaſt <hi>glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings</hi> of hope ſhine forth from theſe <hi>Evening-Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> of any ſuch thing. This I freely declare as one not intereſſed in any Party any further than they are in the Truth, and it is not the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but as ſhe has the Truth on her ſide, and is the moſt eminent and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Specimen</hi> of the Accompliſhment of the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in the whole Reformation (and that it is the adequate fulfilling of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

               </head>
               <p>WE ſhall add ſome few more ſtrictures upon ſeveral paſſages of the fore-mentioned <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar.</hi> As upon <hi>pag.</hi> 38. That the ingenious Author miſlikes our Engliſh Tranſlation's rendring <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:34043:232"/>the four <hi>Beaſts,</hi> which bears an ill ſenſe in all other places of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> as anſwering to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is not to be found fault withal. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in his Anſwer to a Friend calls them inſtead of [the four <hi>Beaſts</hi>] (the four <hi>Wights</hi>) a word which our Engliſh Tranſlators, I ſuppoſe, did not adventure on, it being worn out of uſe, otherwiſe it would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly anſwer to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it ſignifying ſo much as a living Creature. But the deſerting of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theſe four Beaſts or living Creatures, and making them a Repreſentation of the Apoſtles (as ſome ſhallow Interpreters make them the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts) poſted at the four Angles of the Throne as an univerſal Miniſtry diffuſing the Goſpel into all parts of the World; and the pure <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Miniſtry to be Typed by the twenty four Elders, this is a ſlip of his in no wiſe commendable. For firſt, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Genius of the Prophetick Stile to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> any other than a <hi>Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> not one ſingle or ſome few perſons. This is a general Rule from which there is no Exception, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that of the Lamb, which ſignifies the Perſon of Chriſt, though it may be with a Connotation of his Church, his Body. And then ſecondly, it ſeems won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous harſh to interpret the four Wights of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and the twenty four Elders of the Jewiſh; whenas without all queſtion, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has unexceptionably made it out, that Viſion is a Repreſentation (or has a reference thereto) of the Camp of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So that the <hi>four Wights</hi> are as well <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> as the twenty four Elders. And the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four Elders wearing <hi>Crowns,</hi> and the four Wights not ſo, plainly indicates that the one are the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the other, and therefore are but one <hi>congenerous</hi>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:34043:232"/>Polity. And the Reaſons which he produces to the contrary are but ſlight. For the four <hi>Beaſts</hi> or <hi>Wights</hi> are no more employ'd in the ſervices of the New Teſtament time than the twenty four Elders: For whatever any of them are ſaid to do, reſpects the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> time. And for their being made to ſay, <hi>Come and ſee,</hi> at the opening the four firſt Seals, we are to conſider that the three latter of thoſe Seals reſpect rather the <hi>Empire</hi> than the <hi>Church.</hi> And it is not as an <hi>Iſraelitiſh Elder</hi> that he informs <hi>John</hi> of the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi>'s prevailing to open the Seals, but as a <hi>crowned Prince,</hi> it becoming ſuch a Perſonage to inſtruct <hi>John</hi> touching the Almighty's deriving <hi>Power</hi> to Chriſt both to foretel, and <hi>ſo</hi> to adminiſter the Affairs in the World, as to cauſe his own Predictions to be true.</p>
               <p>But now for the Doxology of the twenty four El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>alone, Chap.</hi> 11.16. without any of the four Beaſts, it is not intended to ſignifie the Chriſtian Church <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>univerſally</hi> pure, but <hi>confinedly</hi> to theſe Elders; But it marvellouſly ratifies my ſenſe of things, that theſe <hi>crowned</hi> Elders ſignifie <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Monarchs,</hi> and that therefore the Doxology of the Elders is here mentioned, and that of the Beaſts left out, to denote the gladſom ſenſe of thoſe Kings and Princes, that had caſt off the Tyranny of Antichriſt or Papal yoke in the Reformation at the Riſing of the Witneſſes. The <hi>People</hi> was to be yet ſubject to their <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Princes,</hi> but theſe <hi>Kings</hi> themſelves to be no longer ſubject to the <hi>Pope,</hi> but to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Sovereigns in their own Dominions. And this is the occaſion of their <hi>peculiar</hi> Doxology, which, if the Beaſts had not been left out, would not have been diſcerned. And that one of the four Beaſts
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:34043:233"/>within the ſame Confines of Time delivers the Vials, that is rather an Argument that the <hi>Beaſts</hi> are pure as well as the <hi>Elders,</hi> and that <hi>Purity</hi> is not confined to them. And 'tis much, if the <hi>Beaſts</hi> were not pure, that they ſhould give the Vials to Angels in pure and white Linen, <hi>pag.</hi> 69.</p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>Inverſion</hi> of this Doxological ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 4.9. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.8. where the Beaſts begin firſt, compared with <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19.4. where the four and twenty Elders are named firſt) theſe things further confirm my Notion of the four and twenty <hi>crowned</hi> Elders that they are <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Monarchs.</hi> For the uſual cuſtom being, that the Doxology, from the <hi>Beaſts</hi> as the <hi>Praecentors</hi> ſhould begin, the <hi>Clergie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the <hi>People</hi> in <hi>Counterdiſtinction</hi> to their <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Monarch,</hi> though otherwiſe highly venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their Archbiſhops, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this Doxolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.4. which ſucceeds that copious deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the utter deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that <hi>Papal Polity</hi> that ſo <hi>Tyrannized</hi> over <hi>Kings,</hi> how naturally does the four and twenty Elders, being placed firſt in this Doxology, though together with the Beaſt or People, denote both that thoſe four and twenty Elders are the <hi>Monarchs</hi> of thoſe Times, and that they have a more <hi>peculiar</hi> gratification in this deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> though the people alſo are greatly gratified thereby, and therefore both join in a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xological Thankſgiving for her deſtruction. But in the <hi>first</hi> place the four and twenty <hi>crowned</hi> Elders.</p>
               <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 45. he places the beginning of the Interval of the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> in the beginning of the ten years Perſecution by <hi>Diocletian:</hi> Becauſe it is ſaid to her that ſhe ſhould have the Tribulation of <hi>ten days,</hi> that is, of ten <hi>Prophetical Days</hi> or years. Which I
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:34043:233"/>will allow to be alluded to alſo; though that Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was not full ten years. But [Day] not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying only a <hi>Prophetical Day</hi> or <hi>Year,</hi> but alſo any particular Seaſon or Time, thoſe ten Days ſignifie chiefly <hi>all</hi> the <hi>ten Perſecutions,</hi> ſo famous in Hiſtory, of which this of <hi>Diocletian</hi> is but one. But there were other ſwingeing ones before, though that the greateſt. And <hi>Spondanus</hi> does juſtly call that firſt of <hi>Nero</hi>'s raiſing, a moſt <hi>direful</hi> Perſecution, and therefore the fitteſt <hi>Epocha</hi> for the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> that Interval having its Name from the <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> of Perſecutions. And as elſewhere, ſo eſpecially in this Prophecy of the Churches, <hi>Alluſion to Names,</hi> as the Author himſelf ſomewhere freely confeſſes, is of no ſmall moment in Prophetical Interpretations.</p>
               <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 47. the laſt Seal he makes the ſpace reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the rallying of Heatheniſm and its Forces, that it may be finally deſtroy'd by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great in the overthrow of <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Argobaſtes,</hi> and of the Paganiſh Forces under them. But this which he would have the laſt or ſeventh Seal, no doubt, is part of the ſixth, which deſcribes a Victory over all the Pagan Forces brought forth in defence of their Idols, that none of them could withſtand the wrath of the Lamb, and this was the Fate of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> and <hi>Argobaſtes</hi> (as well as of others) who were both ſubdued by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 393. or thereabout, even upon the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the ſeven Trumpets. So that, as the whole ſpace of the Church from the beginning to the end of all, is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the ſeven Seals; ſo the ſpace from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſeventh Seal to the end of all, may be comprehended under the ſeven Trumpets. This is the natural diſpoſure of the Apocalyptick Time, as
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:34043:234"/>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has ſolidly made it out. And the half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hours ſilence at the time of Incenſe, is no delay to the Prophetick Time of the ſounding of the ſeven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, which brings on the Vengeance on the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guilty Empire; but is only a Type of the Efficacy of the Prayers of the Church unto God to do them right that had ſuffered, and to execute Juſtice on his own Enemies, which the Thunderings, Lightnings and Earthquake, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. there mentioned ſignifie.</p>
               <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 49. he makes as if at the very ſame time that the Woman had got into the Wilderneſs, the Dragon caſt the floud of the Paganiſh <hi>Barbarians</hi> as it were out of his mouth to have ſwallowed up the <hi>True</hi> Church, but that the <hi>Earthly Church</hi> drunk up the floud by proſelyting thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> to its Pſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochriſtianity, when the Ten Kings gave their ſtrength and Power and Kingdom to the Beaſt. But, firſt, a <hi>floud</hi> of <hi>Contention</hi> and <hi>Diſſenſion,</hi> according to <hi>Scripture-phraſe,</hi> is more ſuitably conceived to come out of the <hi>mouth</hi> of the Dragon, than vaſt Armies of men. Secondly, The floud is ſpued out to carry her away in her flight toward the Wilderneſs, before ſhe could get thither, and by that means to re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh <hi>pure Paganiſm</hi> again in the Empire, as it ſeems to me from <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.15. Which deſign of his was fruſtrated by <hi>Daniel's Earth</hi> or <hi>Clay,</hi> by the <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical</hi> Council of <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> at <hi>Nice,</hi> &amp;c. as I have above declared <hi>Chap.</hi> 40. And thirdly and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, How the <hi>Earthly Church</hi> helped the <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Church, the Woman, by proſelyting the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to a Pagano-Chriſtianity I ſee not. For from hence was the Man of Sin more ſtrongly armed to fight againſt the Witneſſes, and bring upon the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Church all that Miſery and Calamity that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:34043:234"/>Hiſtory records, or Prophecy did prefigure.</p>
               <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 50. he aſſerts, that from the firſt moment of the Time and Times and half a Time, the daily Sacrifice is to be dated as taken away. But if this be true, how can we handſomly come off from making this the <hi>Epocha</hi> alſo of the 2300 <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> Typically or Myſtically underſtood? And ſo the Sanctuary, the Chriſtian Church, will not be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from all Antichriſtian Pollutions till more than a thouſand years hence, as was noted before.</p>
               <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 57. here he ſays, That <hi>Apoc.</hi> 10. the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lion ceaſed of a ſudden, and the Thunders were ſealed up, I ſuppoſe he means of a ſudden. I only take notice that this is ſaid without any the leaſt intimation from the Text. But the <hi>roaring</hi> of the <hi>Lion ſupplying</hi> the <hi>place</hi> of the ſounding of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> this Roaring muſt be underſtood to reach from the ſixth Trumpet to the end of all. And the ſeventh Trumpet comprehending the ſeven Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as the ſeventh Seal the ſeven Trumpets, theſe ſeven Thunders muſt reach to the end of all. So that neither the <hi>ceaſing</hi> of the <hi>roaring</hi> of the Lion, nor <hi>ſealing up</hi> the Thunders, could be of a ſudden.</p>
               <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 58, 59. he here affirms, That the three firſt Churches run out their juſt Intervals, and then ceaſe from their being any longer <hi>Prophetick</hi> Types; but the three laſt, <hi>Thyatira, Sardis</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> run their courſe together to the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and he ſuppoſes none of theſe three to begin before the laſt Semi-time, at the end whereof they paſs into the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi> And that the ſeventh of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches <hi>Laodicea</hi> comes not into play till after the thouſand years Ligation of Satan or bleſſed <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium, pag.</hi> 77. This to me ſeems a marvellous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:34043:235"/>but his chief pretence to this ſurprizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation is this, <hi>pag.</hi> 59. The three firſt, ſays he, have their Promiſes ſo general, that they do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a <hi>Conjunction</hi> betwixt <hi>their time</hi> and the <hi>New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> The three laſt have in their promiſes ſuch Clauſes as do neceſſarily ſuppoſe their <hi>Contact,</hi> as I may ſo ſpeak, with that <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this his main or rather only Reaſon, ſo far as I can diſcover, I briefly anſwer, That the Promiſes neither to <hi>Thyatira</hi> nor to <hi>Sardis</hi> imply any Contact with the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi> Not <hi>Thyatira,</hi> for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to the Victor is only this, That he ſhall have power over the Nations. He does not ſay over <hi>all</hi> Nations. And this was performed in the Riſing of the Witneſſes at the Reformation, when the Popiſh Power in thoſe Principalities and Kingdoms that were reformed was broken apieces like a Potters veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel: To ſuch a meaſure is Power given to the Victor, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſays Chriſt. Where [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] is an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb</hi> of <hi>Proportion,</hi> and is as much as if he ſhould have ſaid, So far as I have received of my Father. Which he explains by adding, [And I will give him the <hi>Morning-Star</hi>] not the <hi>bright Morning-Star,</hi> as Chriſt is called in reference to his Empire in the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium,</hi> or <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate. So that the very Promiſe implies rather a great <hi>diſtance</hi> from the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>-ſtate, than a <hi>Contact</hi> with it. And for the promiſe to the few Names in <hi>Sardis, viz.</hi> to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor there, it is only that he ſhall be cloathed in white raiment, which ſignifies their proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and that their Name ſhall not be blotted out of the Book of life, that is, that their <hi>Seed</hi> ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever, Chriſt will ſo effectually recommend them to his Father, and to the Miniſtry of his Holy
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:34043:235"/>Angels. But he does not ſay that the ſtate of theſe few while ſuch ſhall be contiguous to the <hi>New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>-ſtate, which is the full and ample <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire of Chriſt: but there being but a <hi>few</hi> ſuch <hi>Names</hi> in <hi>Sardis,</hi> it is an Evidence rather that <hi>Sardis</hi> cannot be <hi>contiguous</hi> to the ſtate of the <hi>New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and therefore there muſt be a <hi>larger increaſe</hi> of theſe <hi>few Names</hi> under the next Interval before they can be <hi>contiguous</hi> to the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore as for the third of theſe three, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi> I will allow more to the ingenious <hi>Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dariſt</hi> than he requires, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in the forepart thereof is not only <hi>contiguous</hi> to the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> but <hi>continuous</hi> thereto, a due increaſe of theſe <hi>few Sardian</hi> Names emerging into the Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and ſuch a door of ſucceſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that at laſt ſhe emerges into the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate, that ſtate being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the fulneſs of the <hi>Philadelphian.</hi> This is ſo plain in the Promiſe to the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Victor, that I wonder that any one can wink ſo hard as not to ſee it, whether he will or no. Note only here by the bye, That if the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate of the Church be not part of the <hi>Philadelphian,</hi> it muſt be a Church by it ſelf, and ſo there will be <hi>eight</hi> Churches, not ſeven only, which is contrary to the Viſion. See what the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> ſays to <hi>S. E.</hi> his <hi>Remarks</hi> on this place, and it muſt be full ſatisfaction. Thus invalid is the <hi>Calendariſt</hi>'s ground for making <hi>Thyatira, Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia</hi> all three of them <hi>contiguous</hi> to the commencement of the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now let us briefly conſider the <hi>Incongruity</hi> of the <hi>Poſition it ſelf.</hi> For indeed it ſeems to me to claſh with one of the firſt Principles of rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:34043:236"/>the <hi>Apocalypſe, viz.</hi> the right meaning of the <hi>Septenary</hi> or Number <hi>Seven,</hi> into which when any thing is divided, it denotes that all thoſe parts are there, and no more nor fewer. Wherefore we are neceſſarily to underſtand the ſucceſſion of the Church in this Prophetick Viſion thereof, being caſt into <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> parts, that theſe are <hi>adequately</hi> the parts of this Succeſſion from the beginning of the Church to the end of all, and that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in theſe and <hi>no more</hi> than <hi>theſe.</hi> Whence it is plain, that theſe ſeven Churches are to <hi>ſucceed</hi> one another in <hi>one Line</hi> from the beginning of the Church to the end, becauſe it is a <hi>Line of Succeſſion.</hi> But the <hi>Calendariſt</hi> contrary to this, making <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> Synchronal to <hi>Thyatira,</hi> makes but <hi>five</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions in <hi>one Line</hi> inſtead of <hi>ſeven,</hi> viz. <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> leaving a gap betwixt <hi>Thyatira</hi> and <hi>Laodicea</hi> of no leſs than a thouſand years. Which beſides the <hi>dry Logical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy</hi> in it, looks as <hi>deſormedly,</hi> as if in a row of teeth in ſome Animal, two, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>ſixth</hi> were ſtruck out, and yet to make it ſtill more <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſightly,</hi> two <hi>gobber</hi> teeth were ſet in, one on this ſide, the other on the inner ſide of the fourth, anſwering to <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia</hi> on this ſide and that ſide of Synchronous <hi>Thyatira.</hi> But if the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> Church ſhould be thruſt in here to ſtop that great gap betwixt <hi>Thyatira</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> there would yet be but ſix Succeſſions, and inſtead of <hi>ſeven</hi> there would be eight Churches, as I noted above. So hugely incongruous is this preſent Poſition.</p>
               <p>And though he has ſhow'd a pretty inventive Wit in his managing his Interpretation of the Intervals of the Churches, yet he ſeems to ſit ſomewhat uneaſily
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:34043:236"/>in the matter, raiſing ſuch ſcruples and objections, as none but my <hi>Hypotheſis, viz.</hi> That it is the <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Church that Chriſt directs his Epiſtles to, can free us from. Which <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Churches are, <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea,</hi> all five <hi>ſui juris,</hi> having no <hi>Apoſtatized</hi> Church over them. But <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira</hi> is the <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Church, the former in the greateſt part of its Succeſſion having the <hi>Apoſtatized</hi> Church over them, the latter in its whole Succeſſion. But I cannot inſiſt on theſe things.</p>
               <p>I will only lightly touch upon them, <hi>pag.</hi> 59. I ſay then that <hi>Sardis</hi> is more ſeverely reprehended than <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> becauſe they were the better ſort of people, who could, notwithſtanding their being under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Apoſtatized</hi> Church, keep themſelves unpolluted therefrom, and remain <hi>Apoſtolick:</hi> whenas in <hi>Sardis,</hi> though they be all in the external <hi>Apoſtolick,</hi> or free from the <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> yet the World being got into the Church, it is no wonder they are ſo faulty and ſo ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked. And for that other difficulty, that <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> a much inferiour Church in appearance, ſhould be ſo far honoured above <hi>Sardis,</hi> I ſay, that <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia</hi> is not inferiour, no not ſo much as in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when it does appear at all, which is not till the <hi>ſeventh Vial</hi> under the Conduct of that illuſtrious <hi>Heros</hi> on the white Horſe, who has a Sword coming out of his mouth. This is that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.8.) rendred in our Engliſh, a <hi>little ſtrength,</hi> but ſignifies a <hi>little Army,</hi> but of <hi>great</hi> ſtrength through the Conduct of that <hi>Divine Heros, Apoc.</hi> 19.14. whom theſe Troops follow on white Horſes cloathed in fine Linen white and clean, true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in whom
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:34043:237"/>there is no guile, and five of whom ſhall chaſe an hundred, and an hundred ſhall put ten thouſand to flight, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.8. But this Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is ſo far from being inferiour to <hi>Sardis,</hi> that it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely the beſt and moſt glorious Church that ever will be on Earth, the only unſpotted and alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſecuted Church, according to the deſcription thereof, of all the ſeven. And there being no <hi>more</hi> than <hi>ſeven</hi> Succeſſions, and the Church under the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate being ſtill the Church, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively evident that that <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> Church is part and the better part by far of the Succeſſion of <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> This is thus plain in reaſon, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid alſo to <hi>Philadelphia, Chap.</hi> 3. to this victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Army of that Divine Heros; On him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh I will write the Name of the <hi>City</hi> of my God, <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> which cometh down out of Heaven from my God; it cannot be blindneſs ſo much as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, if any, when he has conſidered it, can ſtill deny that the Time of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in, or at leaſt incident into the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. And <hi>pag.</hi> 60. That <hi>Smyrna</hi> ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended above <hi>Sardis,</hi> there is the like reaſon, as in the firſt Caſe; and beſides, their ſore ſufferings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Chriſt's <hi>Encomiums</hi> as well as the <hi>Crown</hi> of life. And <hi>pag.</hi> 61. That ſcruple why <hi>Thyatira</hi> ſhould be charged with the fault of ſuffering the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs <hi>Jezebel,</hi> when ſhe knew not how to help it, is eaſily taken away, according to my Interpretation, who make it a <hi>Prediction</hi> that this is the Interval wherein the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Church would have the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to caſt out <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and therefore they are blamed that it is not yet done. But this Charge is but <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ſmall</hi> buſineſſes, it being no great fault
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:34043:237"/>that they knew not that the opportunity was ſo near, and a great virtue in them, in that in the mean time they would rather <hi>ſuffer</hi> than <hi>defile</hi> themſelves with <hi>Papal</hi> Pollutions.</p>
               <p>And as for Chriſt's Title in his Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Sardis, pag.</hi> 63. He that has the ſeven Spirits of God and the ſeven Stars. Here [in his right hand] is omitted by a mere Apocalyptical <hi>Ellipſis,</hi> and for no <hi>diminution</hi> to this newly begun Succeſſion of his reſtored Church. But the <hi>ſeven Spirits</hi> and <hi>ſeven Stars</hi> do fully imply as <hi>ſerious</hi> a purpoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of his Church as he had in the firſt propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thereof. This <hi>Sardis</hi> therefore being as it were the <hi>Epheſus</hi> of the Reſtauration, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Chriſt reſumes his Title which he uſes in his Epiſtle to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and that to the <hi>full,</hi> if not <hi>more</hi> in the <hi>ſeven Spirits,</hi> his deſigns of Providence being more great and glorious in his Reſtauration of his Church, than they proved after about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty years ſince the firſt propagation; the Church degenerating apace into the Kingdom of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> till this <hi>Sardian Epocha</hi> of the Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which State, though leſs perfect than it ſhould be, yet it is to paſs into the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> ſtate, and to riſe into a bleſſed <hi>Millennial</hi> Empire of Chriſt, as the other degenerated into the Kingdom of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</hi> So little of diminution is there in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>And being this <hi>Sardian Epocha</hi> is the ſolemn <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of the <hi>Reſtauration</hi> of the Church, why ſhould <hi>Thyatira,</hi> a Succeſſion <hi>antecedent</hi> thereto, be made to run parallel to that of <hi>Sardis;</hi> Or <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which in the Prophecy plainly ſucceeds <hi>Sardis,</hi> be drawn back to run parallel alſo thereto? But I have
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:34043:238"/>out-run my deſign already, and have touched upon more things than I intended. I will now paſs to what I am moſt of all concerned in, the ingenious Author's <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> or <hi>Additional View.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THough I be more concerned to conſider what is in the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> of the <hi>Calendar,</hi> than the <hi>Calendar</hi> it ſelf, that <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> containing <hi>Objections</hi> which the witty Inventor of the <hi>Calendar</hi> has raiſed againſt it out of my Writings, and framed <hi>Anſwers</hi> thereto; yet, partly becauſe I have dwelt already on this <hi>Calendar</hi> of <hi>Prophetick Time</hi> longer than I intended, and partly becauſe I have already noted
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:34043:238"/>ſuch things as may ſatisfie the Reader touching the Matters betwixt the <hi>Calendariſt</hi> and my ſelf. I ſhall endeavour to be exceeding brief in my ſtrictures on this <hi>Poſtſcript.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, as for his firſt, ſecond and third <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> and <hi>Anſwers, pag.</hi> 80, 81. I have ſo fully ſet down what may ſatisfie the Reader therein in the foregoing forty fifth Chapter, that I will omit ſaying any thing of them here. We come therefore to his <hi>fourth</hi> Objection, <hi>pag.</hi> 82. which is this: But if the Line of 2300 <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> could be ſuppoſed to begin at <hi>Cyrus,</hi> yet the 1335 days, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſet to any other point of time than <hi>Antiochus,</hi> for it is expreſly dated from the taking away the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrifice, and that is enough to deſtroy the <hi>Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar.</hi> His <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this is <hi>ample</hi> and <hi>ingenious,</hi> but the ſumm and ſubſtance is this: That the taking away the daily Sacrifice by <hi>Antiochus</hi> being a Type of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> or <hi>Antichriſt</hi> his taking away the <hi>pure Chriſtian</hi> Service, which was at the beginning of his Reign, this is to be the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the 1335 days, as the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the daily Sacrifice is the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the 2300 <hi>Evening-Mornings literally</hi> underſtood. But here I reply, Why then is not the taking away the pure Chriſtian Service the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the 2300 Days myſtically underſtood, eſpecially I having demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated <hi>Chap.</hi> 45. that the <hi>Epocha</hi> of 2300 days myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally underſtood, cannot be <hi>Cyrus</hi> his taking of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> though it would thus be very pretty, the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Line reaching from <hi>literal Babylon</hi>'s falling, to <hi>myſtical Babylon</hi>'s falling, and from <hi>literal Jeruſalem</hi> reſtored to the <hi>myſtical</hi> or <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> as he urges <hi>pag.</hi> 80. But that <hi>Epocha</hi> I have fully routed in that forty fifth Chapter, and therefore the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:34043:239"/>Typical 2300 days muſt either be in the taking away the Chriſtian pure Service at the commencement of the Reign of the Beaſt, where he would fix the <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> of the 1335 days. (Whence the Church of God will not be cleanſed from the impure Worſhip of Antichriſt till above a thouſand years hence) Or elſe the <hi>Epocha</hi> muſt be from the taking away the daily Sacrifice, which is moſt true, but this will again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy infallibly the ingenious Author's <hi>Calendar,</hi> which I think I have hinted above alſo.</p>
               <p>We paſs therefore to the <hi>fifth</hi> Objection. The Beaſt's time began before 400, and that ſpoils the <hi>Calendar</hi>-Account. In Anſwer to this he recurs to that witty Invention of his, whereby he concludes 404 years after the Refurrection to be the Time of the Purity of the Church, and conſequently the 437 of our Lord to be the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Time of the Beaſt. But this is already refuted in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going forty fifth Chapter, ſo that I need ſay nothing more here. Furthermore to my Argument drawn from the proportion of the <hi>outer</hi> Court to the <hi>inner,</hi> he anſwers, Firſt, That let <hi>Villalpandus</hi> his Meaſures be never ſo punctual, the Text ſeems not to point at <hi>Time,</hi> but to the Churches <hi>Purity</hi> or <hi>agreement</hi> with <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Meaſures. Secondly, <hi>Villalpandus</hi>'s Meaſures are adjuſted to the <hi>Temple,</hi> but the <hi>Viſion</hi> to the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and City to make the <hi>outer</hi> Court. Whence <hi>Villalpandus</hi> his Meaſures will be unapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the buſineſs. Thirdly, The Church ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing with the <hi>Eremitical</hi> Woman, was retired into the Temple worſhipping before the golden Altar of Incenſe, the daily Sacrifice being taken away, <hi>viz.</hi> at the entrance of the Reign of the Beaſt, before which time he ſuppoſes the <hi>outer</hi> Court was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:34043:239"/>Fourthly, Although it be hence, that the <hi>first</hi> Viſion of the <hi>Opened Book</hi> does not begin ſo high as the <hi>ſeven Churches</hi> or <hi>Seals,</hi> yet this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true Apocalyptick Order; which firſt compleats the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Trumpets</hi> begun to the very end of the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> time, and then begins from the very <hi>first</hi> in the Woman cloathed with the Sun as a new ſet of Viſions.</p>
               <p>But to the firſt I reply, This meaſuring reſpects not only the <hi>Purity</hi> of the Church, but the <hi>Time</hi> of the viſible Church continuing pure, elſe why is that <hi>third proportional</hi> ſo ſeaſonably offered in the Viſion. To the ſecond, That <hi>Villalpandus</hi> his Meaſures are adjuſted to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which is <hi>Typical</hi> or <hi>Prophetical;</hi> but the City being added, it is <hi>Iconiſmorum Metallaxis,</hi> uſual with the Prophets, to typifie one thing by more Symbols than one. And by the <hi>Holy City</hi> is ſignified the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated in the <hi>outer Court</hi> to worſhip, and anſwers to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the <hi>inner</hi> Court. To the third I ſay, The <hi>retiring</hi> into the <hi>Temple</hi> can be no fit Symbol of the Woman in the Wilderneſs (by Wilderneſs Paganiſm being emblematized, as <hi>Alcazar</hi> has noted, and brought a Cloud of Witneſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, and the reaſon thereof is added in my <hi>Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet of Iconiſms:</hi> So little congruity is there betwixt the Woman's retiring into the <hi>Temple,</hi> and her being in the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> which is as wide and vaſt as the <hi>two-winged</hi> Empire <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern Re-pagani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,</hi> and ſo becoming a Wilderneſs or Deſart. And for the <hi>outer</hi> Court's being commenſurable before the entrance of the Reign of the Beaſt, we were not come to the <hi>outer</hi> Court then, and the Viſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the <hi>external</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi> ſtate of the Church.
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:34043:240"/>To the fourth and laſt I reply, That the making the <hi>outer</hi> and <hi>inner</hi> Court ſynchronous, does moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly infer the <hi>first Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Opened Book</hi> not to begin ſo high as that of the ſeven Churches and Seals. Which is an <hi>intolerable abſurdity,</hi> and as great a piece of violence as can be done to the ſacred Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Prophecies. And now for the <hi>Calenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi>'s Apocalyptick Order; ſo far it is true, as that it points to the running through the Hiſtory of the Trumpets begun to the very end of Apocalyptick Time; which is the thing that is done in the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Lion-Angel</hi> diſtributed into ſeven Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which are equal put together to the ſpace of the ſeventh or laſt Trumpet, which therefore reach to the very end of <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Time. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angel having declared that there was no more time than this ſeventh Trumpet, which he had in ſo general a touch run thorough after his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Book to <hi>John</hi> to be eaten, <hi>John</hi> is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately bid to propheſie. And therefore the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>meaſured Temple</hi> and <hi>Witneſſes</hi> is as certainly the <hi>firſt Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Opened Book-Prophecy,</hi> as any thing in the World can be certain. And if it be ſo, the <hi>Calendariſt</hi> himſelf cannot but confeſs it begins as high as the ſeven Churches or the Seals. But if he imagine the Hiſtory of the Trumpets begun to be compleated to the end of Apocalyptick Time in the Viſion comprized in the eleventh Chapter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſecond Woe's being ſaid to be paſt, and the ſeventh Trumpet ſounding to make the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Woman cloathed with the Sun the firſt Viſion of the <hi>Opened Book</hi>-Prophecy, as commencing as high as the ſeven Churches or Seals; there is he out again. For that Viſion in the eleventh Chapter
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:34043:240"/>does not reach to the end of <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Time, but to the ſeventh Vial only incluſively. So that the <hi>Deſcent</hi> of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Millennial</hi> Reign of Chriſt and the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Interval are ſtill behind. But the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Time upon the ſeventh Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der above-mentioned was quite ended, and ſo a fit Regreſs made to a <hi>new ſet</hi> of <hi>Prophecies.</hi> Which the ingenious <hi>Calendariſt</hi> cannot deny but that it ought to begin as high as the ſeven Churches and the Seals: And then of neceſſity the Time of the <hi>inner</hi> Court will not be <hi>ſynchronous,</hi> but <hi>antecedent</hi> to the Time of the <hi>outer.</hi> Which is a very plain Truth, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually uſeful.</p>
               <p>He makes my ſecond Argument for the forty two months beginning before 400; That the Invocation of Saints had entred ſomewhat before it. In Anſwer to which he recurs again, <hi>pag.</hi> 84. to the device of the Balance. But my Reply to his Anſwer to the <hi>fifth</hi> Objection will ſerve here. So that I will add nothing further, but remind the Reader, that not only the <hi>Invocation</hi> of Saints, but the repoſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the <hi>Mahuzzim</hi> was then, and this exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſpread, as has been proved <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Objection and the Anſwer being leſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to my purpoſe, I omit. We therefore paſs to the ſeventh and laſt, which is this: The Witneſſes are riſen, and out of their Sack-cloth, and that ſome years ago, and therefore the 1260 years are alſo ſo long ago expired, which utterly ſubverts the <hi>Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, pag.</hi> 85. This, ſays he, being the great Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, requires the moſt diſtinct Anſwer, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore briefly explain my full ſenſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In purſuance of this, I confeſs, he is <hi>witty, operoſe</hi> and <hi>copious;</hi> but the ſubſtantial ſumm of the matter, ſo far as I can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:34043:241"/>is this, That as the Time of the <hi>Medial Viſions</hi> is diſtinguiſhed into parts, A Time and Times and Half a Time, and three Days and an Half; ſo there are ſeveral Degrees of the Completion of the Viſion. To this ſenſe is that which occurs <hi>pag.</hi> 78. By all which it appears, ſaith he, <hi>Time at large</hi> has a <hi>leſs full</hi> preſence of the <hi>Event,</hi> and admits a contrary, <hi>inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Time</hi> hath the <hi>full</hi> preſence of the Event, and admits no contrary. And <hi>pag.</hi> 88. Some (ſays he, ſpeaking of the Witneſſes) are called up into places of Dignity as into Heaven, but not as they ſhall be at the end of the 1260 days. For each firſt and laſt part of all the Characters of Time muſt have degrees of the Event, elſe they could not have a foundation to be ſo diſtinguiſhed. Even our Lord's firſt Night was a beginning to dye in his Agony being betray'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And till the Evening of the firſt day of the week he appeared not to a Number, as not publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſen till the end of the third day. And then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeveral inſtances of the ſcantneſs of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of great Objects ſtill remaining of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſorrow; to conclude then, ſays he, <hi>pag.</hi> 89. till after the <hi>full</hi> Expiration of the Time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, being in Power as a Throne or Kingdom in all its coextenſive Characters, the Witneſſes are not, in <hi>full</hi> Apocalyptick ſenſe, Riſen: as the golden Key of the Time, the three days and an half alſo aſſure us. For till the Emphatical <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or, After three days and an half are fully paſt they riſe not, <hi>viz. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly,</hi> as our Lord did not. And that that is not yet (beſide the credit of our <hi>Calendar</hi>) is apparent, in that ſince the Reformation there have been no effects like thoſe that are to ſignalize the end of the 1260 days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:34043:241"/>
               <p>This is the main of his <hi>Anſwer,</hi> to which I briefly <hi>reply,</hi> that it reaches not the caſe. For the <hi>utmoſt</hi> fulfilling of the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Riſing of the Witneſſes</hi> is not that there ſhall be a Riſing of them <hi>throughout</hi> the Kingdom of the Beaſt; but that it ſhall be only in <hi>part</hi> of his Kingdom. For it is expreſly ſaid in the Text, that at the very hour of their Riſing, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>tenth</hi> part of the City fell, not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, betwixt which there is as much difference as betwixt ten and one. For as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> [the third part] which is a Symbol of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, does not ſignifie the whole <hi>Habitable</hi> or then <hi>inhabited Earth,</hi> but the <hi>third</hi> part of the Earth only, ſo the <hi>tenth</hi> part of the City cannot ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>all</hi> the <hi>ten parts</hi> of the City or the whole City, but the <hi>tenth</hi> part only. Beſides that, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does not here relate to the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beaſt or <hi>Secular Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> but to the <hi>Hieratical</hi> Polity the City of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> the <hi>tenth</hi> of that only fell, but the <hi>Secular</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire where this fall was, ſtood rather more ſtrong than ever, was more complete than ever, being rid of the <hi>Papal Tyranny</hi> at the Reformation ſo far forth as it was reformed. And now for the <hi>Emphatical</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>After</hi> the three days and an half; Foraſmuch as it is ſaid <hi>after</hi> theſe three days and an half the Witneſſes roſe, and the <hi>tenth</hi> part of the City fell, it is as clear as Noon-day that no more than a <hi>partial</hi> Fall of the City and a proportionated Riſing of the Witneſſes is the <hi>full</hi> completion of this Viſion or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. But whatever other <hi>Acceſſions</hi> there are to be made to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Ruine</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> they muſt be the completion of ſome other Viſions, but not of this. And as for the Credit of his <hi>Calendar,</hi> I have again and again ſhown how
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:34043:242"/>frail it is. And for any Effects to ſignalize the end of the 1260 days I have demonſtrated elſewhere, that not <hi>Days,</hi> but <hi>Semi-times</hi> are the meaſuring <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> of the <hi>Event</hi> of this Viſion. And that there was no ſignalizing Effect at the expiration of the 1260 days from the right <hi>Epocha,</hi> it is a further confirmation that not a <hi>Day,</hi> but a <hi>Semi-time</hi> is the <hi>Eventual Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> and the <hi>laſt Semi-time</hi> was <hi>ſignalized</hi> with the <hi>bleſſed Reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet, as if his Anſwer to this ſeventh Objection had been in it ſelf ſolid and valid, and that, as he has explained things, the Witneſſes were not Riſen in a <hi>full</hi> Apocalyptick ſenſe; he propoſes three Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections out of what he has read of mine.</p>
               <p>The firſt Objection is this, The latitude of months for the fulfilling Events in ſome parts of them, may ſo diſagree with the narrower lines of day, too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the months (<hi>pag.</hi> 90.) that the Prophecy may be made to contradict it ſelf, and ſo ſpeak <hi>true</hi> and <hi>not true</hi> as to point of Time and Events together. True in the <hi>months,</hi> not in the <hi>days.</hi> But his Anſwer is this, As the heighth of Events is by the Prophecy determined to the <hi>intimate</hi> part of the three days and the three times and an half, ſo the duration of the Event at large is by the Prophecy <hi>co-extended</hi> to the very laſt day of the 1260, and cannot end ſooner, and therefore the days muſt over-rule the months, as being more preciſely fixt in the point of Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to this I <hi>reply,</hi> That the Anſwer is indeed inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, ſaving that he was not aware, that the <hi>partial</hi> Fall of the City and the then Riſing of the Witneſſes was <hi>after</hi> the three days and an half, according to his <hi>own Emphatical</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which plainly implies that the Viſion points at no more than a <hi>partial</hi> Fall of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:34043:242"/>
                  <hi>Babylon,</hi> and a commenſurate Riſing then of the Witneſſes, and that there is no ſuch duration of the Event at large co-extended by the Prophecy to the very laſt day of the 1260, but that they ſignifie no more preciſely than that Authentick meaſure of the Time and Times and half a Time in <hi>Daniel,</hi> as I have demonſtrated <hi>Chap.</hi> 25. And though this pretended preciſeneſs to a day will not neceſſarily argue any improvements of <hi>Omniſciency</hi> in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time above what was attained to in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s, yet it looking as if it did, why may not the Divine Wiſdom think good to prevent that Cavil in Atheiſtical men, by keeping to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Authentick meaſure in theſe <hi>Medial Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Objection</hi> is, The greatneſs of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents requires a larger ſcope than of a <hi>Prophetick</hi> day or <hi>year</hi> to be fulfilled in. To which he anſwers: The preparations to the Events may be ſo going on before, that the Events themſelves may, as the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> going out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> be in the ſelf-ſame day. And ſo the Beaſt's laſt month may by its greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs allow room for thoſe preparations about its lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end, though not fulfilled till the laſt day. But when God will work, who can let it? <hi>Nullum tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus occurrit Regi.</hi> But to this I briefly reply, There is not a <hi>preparation</hi> to Riſing only, but a long ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of their <hi>actual</hi> Riſing not confinable to a year, as is apparent in the Reformation begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> which I have demonſtrated to be the Riſing of the Witneſſes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. of this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Objection</hi> is this, The Expectation of the Witneſſes yet to riſe, diſquiets mens thoughts into <hi>Turbulency,</hi> and gives them meaner eſteems of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the preſent Eſtate of the Church.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:34043:243"/>It would ſwell this Chapter into too great a bigneſs to ſet down all that he ſays in Anſwer to this; I will therefore confine my ſelf to the three firſt Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, he anſwers, That the Prophecy anathematizes all ſuch diſorderly motions, whether the Witneſſes are riſen or not. For it will be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Princes themſelves, Chriſtian Princes and by Inſtruments in pure Linen, not as in the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, not by <hi>Mahometan,</hi> much leſs by <hi>Popular</hi> Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The very hopes or deſires that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould fall, as every one knows as yet it is not fallen, may be charged with the ſame ill conſequences.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Reformation is acknowledged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelf to be the Witneſſes Riſen and the Church out of the Wilderneſs, but not to the full ſenſe of the Prophecy, the Beaſt being yet in power <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>To the firſt Particular I reply, That it is ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and commendable that it does ſo expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt popular <hi>Turbulency</hi> and <hi>Tumult.</hi> But that the Witneſſes are Riſen already I have proved <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. and that they wear not Sack-cloth after their Riſing, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. Wherefore what belongs to Princes themſelves and their Inſtruments in pure Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, hath nothing to do with the Viſion of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but with the <hi>Vials</hi> which <hi>follow</hi> the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> Which may be the <hi>Political</hi> Event of the <hi>fourth</hi> Vial.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond; I deny that the hopes or deſires of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s further falling may be charged with the ſame ill conſequences that a pretended ſet time of its farther Fall, or Riſing of the Witneſſes, ſuppoſe of twelve or thirteen years hence, is chargeable with.
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:34043:243"/>For there being no time ſet, there is no <hi>Watch-word</hi> given to attempt, nor any Expectation of people raiſed.</p>
               <p>And to the third I briefly reply, That though the Reformation is acknowledged within it ſelf to be the <hi>Witneſſes Riſen</hi> and the <hi>Church out</hi> of the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> by the better ſort of knowing men, yet others are of another opinion, and moſt of the Sectarians in Proteſtant Countries are too apt to phanſie themſelves the mournful Witneſſes in Sack-cloth, and therefore if any ſet a time, as if the 1260 days were not expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as yet, but that they will expire ſo many years hence when there will be a <hi>complete</hi> Riſing of the Witneſſes, or at leaſt a putting off their Sack-cloth, this muſt naturally raiſe the Expectation of the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and hazard Commotions even in Proteſtant Countries.</p>
               <p>For the preventing of which inconvenience, I have been ſo vigilant and induſtrious to repreſent a true and faithful ſenſe of the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Riſing of the Witneſſes,</hi> and to demonſtrate to all the World, as I am certain I have done, that the Completion of that Prophecy is perfectly paſt, both the Riſing of the Witneſſes, and their putting off their Sack-cloth at once: And though the ingenious <hi>Calendariſt</hi> has attempted many witty plauſibilities in his adjuſting his <hi>ſix Collateral Lines</hi> to his <hi>Principal</hi> Line of the 2300 <hi>Evening-Mornings</hi> myſtically underſtood for the inferring that in the year 1697. that is, about twelve or thirteen years hence the time of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes propheſying in Sack-cloth will expire, and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Woe paſs away; And upon the ſeventh Trumpets ſounding, there will inſue a moſt loud and publick adminiſtration of the Goſpel beyond any
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:34043:244"/>time ſince the Apoſtles, deſcribed as ſeven <hi>Voices</hi> or the <hi>ſeven Thunders</hi> unſealed; And that thirty years after the beginning of this, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year 1727. ſhall begin the <hi>final</hi> deſtruction of the Beaſt by the <hi>Vials</hi> accompliſhed in forty five years more at the year 1772. in the <hi>New Jeruſalem:</hi> yet the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo much of a <hi>witty, peaceful</hi> and <hi>loyal</hi> good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this little Eſſay of his, I am confident, that he has that perſpicacity that he will, from what I have writ, eaſily diſcern himſelf miſtaken in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and that his <hi>Calendar</hi> of <hi>Prophetick Time,</hi> though there be many uſeful and laudable things no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the managing it, has no firm ground to ſtand upon.</p>

                  <hi>Roman</hi> Church; where he tells us, that this <hi>Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Doctrine (which afterward proved the very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Henry Nicolas</hi> the Father of the Family of Love) did obtain amongſt them at the beginning of the thirteenth Century, <hi>viz.</hi> That every Perſon of the Holy Trinity had his ſucceſſive Time of Ruling the World; That the Law of the Father continued till Chriſt's Coming, the Law of the Son till their Time, and then the Time of the Holy Ghoſt was to begin; In which the uſe of <hi>Sacraments</hi> was to <hi>ceaſe,</hi> and all <hi>external</hi> Adminiſtrations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they ſo highly extolled <hi>Love,</hi> that what would have been a ſin without it, they thought to be none with it, as Fornication, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the Primitive <hi>Nicolaitiſm,</hi> which was again renew'd by <hi>H.

               <p>I will paſs hence to <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, &amp;c. where [the third Part] mentioned at leaſt half a ſcore times, I interpret to be a <hi>Symbol</hi> of the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> and there is very good reaſon for it from what occurs <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.4. where the great <hi>red Dragon</hi> with ſeven Heads and ten Horns, which moſt certainly denotes the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, according to all Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, is ſaid to have drawn down with his Tail the <hi>third part</hi> of the Stars of Heaven, and to have caſt them to the Earth, that is, to have brought the <hi>third part</hi> of the Kingdoms of the World under his ſubjection. Which paſſage is an <hi>intended Key</hi> to that in the <hi>eighth</hi> Chapter, as the <hi>ſeventeenth</hi> Chapter is chiefly to the <hi>eleventh</hi> and <hi>thirteenth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ninth Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 8. where the <hi>Locuſts</hi> are ſaid to have hair as the <hi>hair of Women,</hi> I, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> before me, interpret of the <hi>Saracens</hi> which are <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> of whom <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, <hi>Nat.

               <p>In the eighteenth Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 23. I content my ſelf
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:34043:246"/>in noting that the voice of Bridegroom and Bride being no more heard in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſignifies that there ſhall be no more propagating of their Pſeudo-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, the end of Marriage being Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this is a true ſenſe and unexceptionable; But it might have been fuller, if we had noted alſo, that there may be an alluſion to that <hi>uſurped Title</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> who calls himſelf <hi>Sponſus Eccleſiae.</hi> For then the proſelyting of Nations and Countries to the Papal Religion and Juriſdiction, would look ever like a <hi>new Marriage.</hi> But the Joy of ſuch Marriages will ceaſe after the final Fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in this eighteenth Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> See <hi>Gabriel Powel</hi> in his <hi>De Antichriſto, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>And there ſhall be no more curſe.</hi> This I expound of the furious Papal <hi>Anathema's</hi> or Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to depoſe Kings and Princes, and to involve the Chriſtian World in blood, which I do not doubt but is the proper Prophetical meaning of the place, and not the <hi>Curſe</hi> of God for <hi>Sin,</hi> which was <hi>Diſeaſes, Death, Briars, Thorns,</hi> the <hi>labour</hi> and ſweat of <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,</hi> and the like. That Curſe we ſhall never be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from till we come to Heaven. And thoſe that phanſie ſuch things here on Earth in the <hi>New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> ſtate; as in this paſſage, ſo in all other paſſages that ſound ſo high, they are to remember, that the <hi>proper</hi> fulfilling of them is to be in <hi>Heaven,</hi> though in a <hi>figurative</hi> ſenſe they will be fulfilled here, and that the deſcription of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> on Earth is ſo framed, as to be alſo <hi>Typical</hi> of the State of the Church in <hi>Heaven,</hi> as I have more fully declared in Chapter 20. of theſe <hi>Paralipomena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as, beſides this miſtake in <hi>S. E.</hi> I
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:34043:246"/>find a ſober and judicious Writer <hi>W. A.</hi> in his <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> of the <hi>State of the Church</hi> in the <hi>latter Ages of the World</hi> to incline to the Opinion, that there will be even a Change of <hi>Nature</hi> in the Time of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate of the Church: I will a while here divert into what he ſays <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. and produce the moſt material Reaſons he hath for the proving, that in thoſe days there will be a Change of the World <hi>Natural</hi> as well as the World <hi>Moral,</hi> as he phraſeth it. Thoſe places of Scripture that ſeem to promiſe plenty of things, and increaſe of People, I conceive, imply no ſuch <hi>Radical</hi> Change in the World <hi>Natural.</hi> For merely from the <hi>Moral</hi> Temperance of men in thoſe Times there will be <hi>length</hi> of <hi>Days</hi> and the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>ſound Off-ſpring,</hi> this with <hi>Peacefulneſs</hi> will cauſe <hi>Populouſneſs;</hi> And for <hi>Plenty,</hi> which depends upon the <hi>Clouds</hi> and timely and ſeaſonable Showres, they have ever been and will be at the Command of the <hi>inviſible Powers</hi> in the Air. So that that will be no <hi>inſititious</hi> Change in the <hi>Natural</hi> World, but the effects of <hi>free Actions</hi> in thoſe <hi>inviſible Agents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that indeed of <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> 65.20. if not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpreted, may ſeem to argue a Change of things more than what depends upon what is <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Moral.</hi> For after God had promiſed he would <hi>create a new Heaven</hi> and a <hi>new Earth, v.</hi> 17. he adds a little afterwards, That there ſhall be no more thence an Infant of days, nor an Old man that has not fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his days. For the Child ſhall dye an hundred years old, but the Sinner being an hundred years old ſhall be accurſed. Here the <hi>Child dying an hundred years old,</hi> to the heedleſs may import, that they ſhall be more longaevous then, than the Patriarchs before the Floud, an Hundred being to a Thouſand, as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:34043:247"/>the Age of a Child to Seventy, which would imply a ſtrange Change in the <hi>Natural</hi> World indeed. But to give <hi>W. A.</hi> his due, he has pitched upon the moſt likely ſenſe of this Verſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That there ſhall no Child ordinarily dye by any untimely death, nor an Old man that has not lived ſo long as in the courſe of Nature he might well reach; That the ſpace from Childhood to old Age ſhall ordinarily be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I deny that this argues any more than what depends upon a <hi>Divine Morality</hi> or <hi>real Regeneration</hi> in their Parents, who will tranſmit a ſound and wholeſom conſtitution to their Poſterity. Which if any one of them do not improve to the like Vertue and Piety, and yet by the Benefit of their Conſtitution live an hundred years, content mainly with the things of the <hi>Animal life,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Sinner</hi> as this, notwithſtanding his <hi>Longaevity,</hi> is <hi>accurſed,</hi> both becauſe he for the preſent deprives himſelf of the enjoyments of the <hi>Divine life,</hi> and muſt expect alſo but a bad Reception (when he dyes) into the other State.</p>
               <p>The next Text of moment which he urges is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. <hi>The Creature</hi> it ſelf <hi>alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the Children of God:</hi> Which he would have to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that there will be a Change of the World <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> in the bleſſed <hi>Millennium</hi> as well as in the World <hi>Moral,</hi> he ſuppoſing that [Creature] there ſignifies the <hi>whole ſublunary Creation</hi> at leaſt. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 22. ſays, <hi>For we know that the whole Creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together until now.</hi> Where [the whole Creation] is the ſame with [the Creature it ſelf] not Chriſtians <hi>quatenus</hi> Chriſtians, but the <hi>very Creature</hi> or Creature <hi>it ſelf</hi> groaneth
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:34043:247"/>and is in pain. But then it is to be underſtood, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> alſo will have it, of the <hi>whole</hi> Humane <hi>Creature,</hi> which he makes out rationally and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly. And what Creatures but <hi>humane</hi> or <hi>Men</hi> can expect to be delivered into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God? This therefore does not reſpect the <hi>Jeruſalem-ſtate</hi> of the Church here on <hi>Earth,</hi> but the State of the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> For then only will this deliverance from the bondage of Corruption be, and the attainment of the freedom of the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> which is the Title of the <hi>Angels.</hi> For then in our incorruptible glorified bodies we ſhall become <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Something like this Text is that alledged out of the <hi>Acts, Chap.</hi> 3.21. where S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of our bleſſed Saviour, ſaith, <hi>Whom the Heaven muſt receive until the Times</hi> of Reſtitution of all things <hi>which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets ſince the world began.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> were to be rendred as our Engliſh Tranſlation renders it <hi>[Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution]</hi> implying thereby <hi>Reſtauration</hi> or <hi>Renovation.</hi> But <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> therefore ſignifies either the <hi>Periodical</hi> Times, that is to ſay, the <hi>Times brought to a Period,</hi> or the <hi>Times</hi> of <hi>effecting</hi> of all things which God hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:34043:248"/>by the mouth of his holy Prophets. Which eaſie ſenſe implies no ſuch Change in the World <hi>Natural</hi> in the <hi>Millennium,</hi> as our Author would deduce therefrom. And this is not my ſenſe only on the Text, but <hi>Grotius</hi> his alſo, or ſomething in him near akin to it. As for that <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.22. <hi>For as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth which I will make ſhall remain before me, ſaith the Lord, ſo ſhall your ſeed and your name remain.</hi> This <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> as that <hi>Chap.</hi> 65.17. is a <hi>Political</hi> Heaven and Earth, that <hi>Divine Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> which will conſtitute the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate of the Church, in which the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Iſraelites</hi> will have a portion as long as that <hi>Polity</hi> ſtands, which is to the end of all.</p>
               <p>But I have made ſo much haſte, that I have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a prime Text alledged by this ingenious Author, <hi>Iſai. Chap.</hi> 65. <hi>The Wolf and the Lamb ſhall feed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Lion ſhall eat ſtraw like the Bullock, and duſt ſhall be the Serpents meat, they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountain, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And a fuller deſcription to the ſame purpoſe there is <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. which he produces to prove, that there will be a Change in the World <hi>Natural</hi> in the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium</hi> as well as in the <hi>Moral</hi> World, he urging the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe of theſe places for theſe three Reaſons following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Wolf and Lamb, the Lion and Bullock are ſuppoſed to retain their Original proper Natures ſtill. For if not, then the Wolf would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Lamb, and the Lion a Bullock, and then in the myſtical ſenſe, (which he oppoſes) it would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be, that the Lamb and the Lamb would feed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the Bullock eat ſtraw like other Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks.</p>
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:34043:248"/>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, That we cannot well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine for what other purpoſe that ſaying, [The Lion ſhall eat ſtraw like an Ox] ſhould be added, but only to give ſome account how thoſe Creatures ſhall live, and how they ſhall be fed when they ſhall ceaſe to prey upon other living Creatures. Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that the ſenſe is <hi>literal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is, Becauſe it is further added, That duſt ſhall be the Serpent's meat, which further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the foregoing Reaſon, as if the Prophet did perſiſt in inſtructing us how theſe Creatures, when their noxious properties are taken away, ſhall feed and ſuſtain themſelves. Nor did ever any, ſays he, ſo far as I know, eſſay to accommodate this of the Serpent to a <hi>myſtical</hi> ſenſe, when they have done ſo to the other parts of the Prophecy in conjunction with it. Theſe are his three Arguments which are not without ſome wit and judgment; But I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to each.</p>
               <p>To the firſt therefore I ſay, That there is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick <hi>Aſteiſmus</hi> in the Phraſe of the Prophet, when he ſays, The Wolf and the Lamb ſhall feed together, which in the <hi>Cortex</hi> or <hi>Literal</hi> ſenſe ſtrikes the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination ſtrongly, as is the Nature of the Prophetick Stile. But that there may be ſtill an oppoſition in the <hi>Myſtical</hi> ſenſe as there is betwixt the <hi>Wolf</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> it is to be underſtood not <hi>in ſenſu compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſito,</hi> but in <hi>ſenſu diviſo,</hi> That he that had a Wolfiſh nature before ſhall change his nature to that of a Lamb, and accordingly converſe with him of that nature. This is the obvious ſenſe, if we ſtudy not to be over-ſubtil and witty. But beſides this we may conceive, though by the power of the Goſpel, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe Times, theſe ſeveral Beſtian Natures
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:34043:249"/>will be wonderfully corrected and ſubdued, and made obedient to the Heavenly Man Chriſt in us, yet they may retain their <hi>Natural Character,</hi> and this man may become a thoroughly <hi>tamed Wolf,</hi> that a thoroughly <hi>tamed Lion.</hi> And Phyſiognomiſts, we know, refer the natural Temper of men to ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of ſuch Animals, which Inclinations yet may be perfectly ſubdued by real Grace and Vertue, though the <hi>Characters</hi> of their <hi>natural</hi> Inclinations <hi>remain.</hi> Which made <hi>Zopyrus</hi> the Phyſiognomiſt declare <hi>Socrates</hi> Venereous, and when <hi>Socrates</hi> his Scholars laught at him for his miſtake, he rebuked them, and told them, <hi>Zopyrus</hi> ſpoke true, for ſuch he was by Nature, but Vertue had corrected it. There was the natural <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>Goat</hi> on him ſtill, though the life was ſubdued or extinct.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, That the reaſon is obvious, why it is ſaid, that the Lion ſhall eat ſtraw like the Ox, <hi>viz.</hi> that it may correſpond with the <hi>Wolf</hi>'s feeding with the <hi>Lamb,</hi> which is eating graſs with the Lamb, and that they both correſpond with the intended <hi>myſtical</hi> ſenſe of the Parable, which the Concluſion of the Verſe is a Key to. They ſhall not <hi>hurt</hi> nor <hi>deſtroy</hi> in all my holy Mountain. Injury, Violence and Cruelty ſhall ceaſe. No man to <hi>feed</hi> his own <hi>humour</hi> of <hi>Ambition</hi> or <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> ſhall pain and oppreſs his Neighbour. But thoſe <hi>Blood-ſuckers</hi> before, which were like <hi>Wolves</hi> or <hi>Lions,</hi> ſhall be changed from that Temper, that they ſhall pain and injure no living Soul in ſeeking to ſuſtain themſelves in that rank they are, no more than a Wolf or Lion would do by eating graſs or Hay.</p>
               <p>And to the third and laſt, I ſay, My Anſwer to the ſecond is further confirmed by that paſſage tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:34043:249"/>the Serpent, That duſt ſhall be the Serpent's meat as it was before, becauſe his eating duſt hurts no other living Creature. Therefore his food needs not be changed: As thereby is alſo intimated, that his Nature is not. And therefore the <hi>Serpent</hi> is here a <hi>Symbol</hi> of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate</hi> in thoſe days, who though they keep their own ill ſerpentine Nature ſtill, (for they are of their Father the Devil) yet they will be exquiſitely kept in by the righteous Laws of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> Polity, that they ſhall be able to do no hurt, however willing, but live ſo in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to thoſe Laws, that they ſhall acquire their livelihood without violence or injury to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. And according to the richneſs of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Stile it inſinuates alſo what <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderlings</hi> theſe ſort of men will be in thoſe days. As it is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. Thine <hi>Enemies</hi> ſhall <hi>lick the duſt:</hi> and <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. They ſhall <hi>lick the duſt</hi> like a <hi>Serpent,</hi> they ſhall move out of their holes like Worms of the Earth. Theſe are thoſe that undergo in thoſe Times <hi>perpetual ſhame and contempt,</hi> Dan. 12. This I conceive to be the <hi>myſtical</hi> meaning of [Duſt ſhall be the Serpents meat] I have been the more careful in clearing this place, that miſtaken Gloſſes may not obſcure the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of thoſe Times, and ſo blind men from ſeeing they are fulfilled, when indeed they are. See what is ſaid to <hi>S. E.</hi> the Remarker on <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 3. and I hope it will fully ſatisfie.</p>
               <p>For I will haſte now to another Miſtake of this otherwiſe ingenious Writer, which is touching the Battel of the <hi>Heros</hi> on the white Horſe under the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Vial.</hi> For he makes it only a <hi>literal</hi> or <hi>carnal</hi> Warfare, and the deſtruction or killing ſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood only. Whence (1) whereas the Garments
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:34043:250"/>of that <hi>Heros</hi> only, on the white Horſe, are ſaid to be diſtained with blood, his Souldiers garments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing white and clean without any ſpot of blood upon them, he will have to ſignifie, that this <hi>bloody Execution</hi> is to be attributed to <hi>Chriſt alone,</hi> rather than to his Followers on white Horſes, who being ſo few, could do nothing in a manner without Chriſt's miraculous aid, if they did any thing at all with it. And to this ſenſe is alledged <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.19. <hi>When he Enemy ſhall come in like a floud,</hi> the Spirit of the Lord <hi>ſhall lift up a Standard against him.</hi> (2) And he adds <hi>pag.</hi> 137. That beſides this, the Armies of the Dragon, Beaſt and falſe Prophet are ſaid to be <hi>ſlain</hi> by the <hi>Sword proceeding out of the mouth of him that ſat upon the Horſe,</hi> but not one word of his being ſlain by <hi>his Souldiers.</hi> (3) And this being the effect of the <hi>ſeventh Vial,</hi> and the <hi>Vials</hi> being <hi>Plagues,</hi> that the ſlaughter by the Sword coming out of his mouth cannot ſignifie <hi>Converſion,</hi> foraſmuch as <hi>Converſion</hi> is no <hi>Plague,</hi> but a <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> (4) Nor can I, ſaith he, find any where in Scripture that the word, <hi>ſlaying</hi> by the <hi>Sword of God's mouth,</hi> or <hi>breath</hi> of His <hi>lips,</hi> is uſed in ſo favourable a ſenſe as to ſignifie the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> of men from ſin, but either the <hi>denouncing</hi> or <hi>executing evil</hi> againſt them. (5) And in purſuance of this ſenſe of a <hi>carnal</hi> War only, he interprets the great City (<hi>Rev.</hi> 16.19.) divided into three parts of the <hi>great City ſpiritually</hi> called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Aegypt.</hi> (6) And is inclinable to interpret the great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake and the great Hail, <hi>v.</hi> 18, 21. <hi>literally</hi> alſo. But to each of theſe I ſhall briefly make anſwer.</p>
               <p>To the firſt, That Chriſt's Garments only diſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with blood, and that <hi>before the Battel,</hi> does not ſignifie that a bloody Execution <hi>literally</hi> taken, is to
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:34043:250"/>be attributed to Chriſt alone, but it ſignifies the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious <hi>Paſſion</hi> of Chriſt which belongs <hi>alone</hi> to him, and yet in virtue of which <hi>alone</hi> is this great Victory under this ſeventh Vial: which is an Argument that the Warfare is <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> To which that of <hi>Eſay</hi> very well agrees, When the Enemy ſhall come in like a floud, the Spirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a Standard againſt them The <hi>Standard</hi> indeed intimates <hi>War,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit</hi> that it is <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> The Victory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be attributed to the <hi>bloody Paſſion</hi> of Chriſt <hi>only</hi> and to his <hi>promiſed Spirit</hi> in his <hi>Followers</hi> on white Horſes, powerfully urging the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this <hi>Conflict,</hi> to a wonderful ample <hi>Converſion</hi> of the Nations. See my Notes on the place.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond I ſay, That the Armies of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and falſe <hi>Prophet</hi> are not ſaid to be ſlain by the Sword proceeding out of the mouth of him that ſat on the white Horſe, there's not a word of that touching them, but they are ſaid to be taken <hi>alive,</hi> and caſt <hi>alive</hi> into the Lake of fire burning with brimſtone. So that they were <hi>not ſlain</hi> by <hi>that Sword.</hi> But it is ſaid, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the reſt</hi> of thoſe Armies, thoſe that under the <hi>Dragon</hi> fought againſt the <hi>Heros</hi> on the white Horſe, that is, the Infidel Party, they were <hi>ſlain</hi> by the <hi>Sword</hi> of him that ſat on the Horſe, which proceeded out of his mouth. And that there is <hi>not one word</hi> of their being ſlain by <hi>his Souldiers,</hi> is becauſe his <hi>Paſſion alone</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> whereby he ſpeaks and powerfully pleads the Merit of his own Paſſion, does all in all. This is that which will ſo ſucceſsfully ſubdue the Nations to him, as he ſaid of himſelf when he was in the fleſh; <hi>When I am lifted up, I ſhall draw all men unto me,</hi> intimating thereby what death he ſhould dye.</p>
               <pb n="442" facs="tcp:34043:251"/>
               <p>To the third, That though this <hi>Converſion</hi> is no Plague to the <hi>converted,</hi> yet it is ſo to the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet.</hi> For ſuch a world of people being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Purity of the Goſpel, that <hi>Polity</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted will neceſſarily be over-run, melted and diſſolved, and the ſeven Plagues are properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the deſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> or the <hi>Beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the fourth, That if by the Phraſe [ſlaying] by the Sword of God's mouth or breath of his lips, is never underſtood any thing but the denouncing or executing evil againſt men, then the Beaſt and falſe Prophet were ſlain by the Sword coming out of the mouth of him that ſat on the white Horſe, (for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly nothing is here done without his Command) which is a perfect contradiction to the Text. For the Beaſt and falſe Prophet were <hi>caſt alive</hi> into the Lake of fire <hi>not ſlain</hi> by that Sword: which is a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Battel here typified it's being mainly <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> And it is a wonder to me, that any one that takes notice that the very Title of this <hi>Heros</hi> is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and that the <hi>Word of God</hi> is ſaid to be ſharper than any <hi>two-edged Sword,</hi> and that there is <hi>no Weapon</hi> appears here either <hi>on himſelf</hi> or his <hi>Followers</hi> to oppoſe his Enemies with, but this <hi>ſharp Sword</hi> going out of his mouth, ſhould doubt but that this War is mainly <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as I have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it. And that [ſlaying] by the Sword of God's mouth or the breath of his lips ſignifies <hi>Converſion,</hi> there are ſeveral Examples in Scripture thereof, <hi>Iſai. Chap.</hi> 11.4. And he ſhall <hi>ſmite</hi> the Earth with the <hi>rod of his mouth,</hi> and with the <hi>breath of his lips</hi> ſhall he ſlay the wicked. Which <hi>Forerius</hi> and <hi>A Lapide</hi> interpret and <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo, of the <hi>Victory</hi> of the <hi>Word of God</hi> over <hi>wicked men,</hi> ſlaying them <hi>as ſuch,</hi> and
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:34043:251"/>
                  <hi>converting</hi> them to a quite <hi>contrary</hi> ſtate. And thus is Chriſt ſaid by the <hi>Spirit of his mouth,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. to <hi>conſume the man of ſin,</hi> that is, by the power of the Word, as <hi>Calvin</hi> expreſly interprets it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it with that of <hi>Eſay.</hi> See alſo 2 <hi>Eſdr. Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 10, 38. And undoubtedly that Prediction, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.16. I will <hi>fight againſt them</hi> with the <hi>Sword of my mouth,</hi> reſpects the <hi>Converſion</hi> and ſeparation of whole Kingdoms and Nations at the end of the <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirian</hi> Interval from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which came to paſs in the <hi>Reformation.</hi> But we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that this <hi>Converſion,</hi> which is a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to the <hi>Converted,</hi> is a <hi>Wound</hi> and <hi>Cutting</hi> to the Body of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and therefore not inconſiſtent with the ſtate of that War.</p>
               <p>To the fifth, I ſay the great City divided into three parts, cannot be that City ſpiritually called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſoraſmuch as that City is the ſame with <hi>Babylon</hi> the great. Which as great as it is, is but part of the great City there ſaid to be divided into three parts, of which the <hi>Cities</hi> of the <hi>Nations</hi> are one, as the Text plainly intimates, which were <hi>Thunder-ſtruck</hi> by the Evangelical <hi>Boanerges</hi>'s, and fell, that is, were converted, as the <hi>ſlain</hi> by the <hi>Sword</hi> in the other Viſion. And as the unconverted <hi>Beaſt</hi> and falſe <hi>Prophet</hi> are caſt into a Lake of fire there, ſo <hi>Babylon</hi> here <hi>impenitent</hi> blaſphemes, their Power and Polity being broken apieces with a ſtorm of Hail-ſtones of a Talent weight apiece: So eaſie and natural a congruity is there of things, interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Viſions of a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Warfare. And for the three parts which the City is divided into, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it of one great <hi>Oecumenical City</hi> as it were, there is plainly the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Party, and the
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:34043:252"/>
                  <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Party, and the <hi>Infidel</hi> Party, the ſame with the three great Parties of the Armies in <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geddon.</hi> But of any three parts that <hi>Babylon</hi> is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into, there is not the leaſt intimation in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>To the ſixth and laſt, I ſay it is very abſurd in this Book of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> ſo thoroughly <hi>Symbolical,</hi> to interpret <hi>Hail-ſtones</hi> and <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> and the like, <hi>Literally.</hi> And to give the Author his due, he is not over-confident in the caſe. But ſaving ſome few ſuch things as theſe, his Book is excellently well writ, and of very good uſe and ſervice to ſuch as have Genius to theſe Studies.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLIX. <hi>An Anſwer to ſeveral Arguments from an ingenious Hand, that the Intervals of the Viſion of the ſeven Churches do not reach to the end of the World, but to the beginning of the Viſion in</hi> Chap. 4. <hi>which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him reſpects the Times of Queen</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth. <hi>Two difficulties from the ſame hand touching the placing the twenty four Elders and four Beaſts about the Throne, briefly anſwered.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THough the thing the Author of the following Arguments drives at, is to make the Viſion of the 4. and 5. Chapters of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> to concern the Affairs of <hi>England</hi> from the Time of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> to this preſent Age, yet they ſeeming to have ſome colour to prove in general that the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Interval does not reach to the end of the World; and it being a thing of moment to wipe away all pretences to this miſtake, I thought fit to produce them and anſwer them, and to inſert the Anſwer into the number of my <hi>Paralipomena Prophetica.</hi> His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments therefore out of his Papers I had, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As often as thoſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1.) do occur, they never ſuffer the Viſion they belong to, to be expounded of any Event antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Event of the Viſion next before. For this I appeal, ſaith he, to your own Expoſition of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> in all other places, and why this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould be excepted I ſee not. Whence it follows, that the Event of the Viſion of <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. muſt follow that of the Church of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> Wherefore the
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:34043:253"/>Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> does not conclude the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beſides, unleſs <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſerves to ſhew the order of the Events of Viſions, it ſerves to no uſe at all. For as for the order of S. <hi>John</hi>'s receiving of them, it is well enough known by his order of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To which I may add, That for ſureneſs ſake it is not only ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but the Voice tells him withal, that the things which he ſhould ſee were ſuch <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Whereby it ſeems to me, that we are enjoined of neceſſity to expound that Viſion of <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. of ſomething that was to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Viſion of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> For I hope you will not deny but that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> has reſpect to the things next before ſpoken, as well here as in all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are alſo other Conſiderations to prove the connexion and order of the Viſions of the 3. and 4. Chapters. Such as theſe, Chriſt promiſes <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia</hi> an <hi>open door</hi> which no man ſhall be able to ſhut, <hi>i. e.</hi> he tells her, he has ſet this door before her, meaning, as I conceive, that the Church was not yet arrived to this open door, but in ſome time ſhe ſhould. In the next Epiſtle we have Chriſt knocking at <hi>this door</hi> (for what other can it be) to get it open. In the very entrance of <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. the <hi>door</hi> is <hi>opened.</hi> Are theſe three doors the ſame or no? Surely the Text ſeems to intimate they are the ſame.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another Conſideration may be this; When Chriſt promiſes the Victor that he ſhould ſit with him in his Throne, even as he was ſet down with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his; and then immediately after exhibits a moſt glorious Repreſentation of this Throne (<hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:34043:253"/>the Throne of God and of Chriſt) does not this ſeem to look as if the Throne exhibited to view, were that which were juſt before promiſed?</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Interval does not reach to the end of the World, may be evidenced from the placing of the Promiſe to the Victor before the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> which argues it to be a <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> promiſe, when no ſuch can take place, that time when an end ſhall of courſe be put to all <hi>worldly</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And therefore if it was not ſuch a promiſe, but ſimply a promiſe of <hi>Heaven,</hi> it ought to have been placed after the Parabolical <hi>Epiphonema.</hi> So that there is no evaſion from the ſtrength of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, allowing the Rule of placing the Parabolical <hi>Epiphonema</hi> to be true, on <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And laſtly, Suppoſing the Throne to be <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> in a <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, will it not hence follow, that the Victor ſhall ſit in as high a place in Heaven as the Father and the Son do? For it is promiſed to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to ſit with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>his Throne,</hi> even in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as Chriſt ſits with his Father in his, and that muſt be one and the ſame Throne, becauſe Chriſt and the Father are one. Wherefore it can be no <hi>Heavenly</hi> Throne, and therefore it is an Earthly that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and conſequently this Earthly Scene conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues after the Interval of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> Theſe are his Arguments ſet off to the utmoſt advantage, ſo far as my skill could reach. But in Anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the firſt, I demand how thoſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which are but an <hi>Adverb</hi> of <hi>Order in Time,</hi> the ſame that <hi>Poſtea</hi> in Latine, as <hi>Beza</hi> here tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates it, ſhould have that propriety of ſenſe as never to ſuffer the Viſion they belong to, to be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any Event antecedent to the Event of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:34043:254"/>next before, whenas <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies no more than [Afterwards] or [After this] as our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Tranſlation has it, which is moſt eaſily and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally underſtood of the <hi>Viſion precedent,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, After <hi>this Viſion</hi> I looked, and behold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if you will have it, After the <hi>Event</hi> of this Viſion I looked; I demand how could <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi>'s time be ſaid to look up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after an <hi>Event</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, which ſeems a plain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy, whenas <hi>John</hi>'s looking up is about fifteen hundred years on this ſide of that Event. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not from any force or virtue of the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that the Viſion they belong to, is not expounded of any Event antecedent to the Event of the Viſion next before, but from other clear circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or that the Viſions are in the ſame order as the Events they prefigure, and no weight of Reaſon appears to the contrary. And for his Appeal to my Expoſition of the <hi>Apocalyſe,</hi> his ground fails there alſo. For <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. ſome things there are expounded of what is antecedent to the Prediction (<hi>Chap.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 14.) of the Victory of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe all places where <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is found, had been ſo expounded by me, as the Objector phanſies, it does not follow that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> muſt be ſo expounded here, becauſe there are ſuch nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indications to the contrary. 1. For firſt there being ſeven Intervals from the beginning of the Church Apoſtolick, it does both according to the Apocalyptick and Cabbaliſtick ſenſe of [Seven] imply <hi>all</hi> the Intervals of the ſaid Church from that firſt Term. As the <hi>ſeven Seals</hi> beginning from the ſame Term, reach to the end of the World; And ſo the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:34043:254"/>
                  <hi>ſeven Trumpets</hi> from the Term they do commence, reach to the end of the World; And the ſame I doubt not of the <hi>ſeven Thunders,</hi> that they laſt to the very laſt the <hi>Conflagration</hi> it ſelf. And the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> of the Beaſt take in all the Heads of him that are. Wherefore it is rational, that the <hi>ſeven Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals</hi> of the Church take in <hi>all</hi> the Intervals of the Church that are. And therefore I think I ſaw rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that this place, however <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is to be expounded in others, ſhould be excepted. 2. But again, How harſh and abſonous is it to make the <hi>Epiſtolar</hi> Prophecy to reach but to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the Affairs of the Church, and the Prophecies thereof to be continued in Viſions and Prophecies of <hi>quite another mode</hi> and <hi>faſhion?</hi> Does not this look like a ſtrange heterogeneous patch or botch? And is it not infinitely more ſmooth and elegant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Epiſtolar</hi> Prophecy a complete Prophecy of its own kind and manner of contexture, reaching from the beginning of the Church to the end of the World; And that after this begins a <hi>new</hi> Prophecy of the <hi>ſame extent,</hi> but of <hi>another Texture</hi> and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without any connexion to this? <hi>Ne Gryphes jungantur equis</hi>— 3. Thirdly, If <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, after the Event of the Viſion of the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which according to him is the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> then all the whole Prophecy that follows, at leaſt that of the ſeven Seals, which take in alſo the ſeven <hi>Trumpets,</hi> muſt be <hi>after</hi> the Reformation, when no leſs than a <hi>dozen</hi> Viſions, the firſt ſix Seals, and the firſt ſix Trumpets are before. Which plainly ſhows that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> cannot ſignifie ſo, as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector would have it; but that it denotes only the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> in <hi>ſeeing</hi> theſe Viſions, not the <hi>Order</hi>
                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:34043:255"/>of <hi>Events.</hi> 4. Fourthly, Whenas that <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>ſeven Churches,</hi> which commences from the beginning of the Church, is uſhered in with a <hi>great voice</hi> as of a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> and a <hi>like voice</hi> here <hi>as</hi> of a <hi>Trumpet</hi> ſpeaks to S. <hi>John</hi> again, would not this alarm or awaken any heedful Reader's animadverſion, and invite him to conceive, that ſurely here begins or is beginning a new Prophecy <hi>ab ovo</hi> or from the ſame <hi>Epocha,</hi> as before, eſpecially conſidering what is noted in the ſecond place, that there is here in this following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, after which the affairs of the ſucceeding Prophecy are to be. But this <hi>ſhow</hi> in the <hi>Cortex</hi> is but an artificial <hi>Blind,</hi> that which I call <hi>Lemmatoſynechia,</hi> intended, as ſeveral other Artifices, for the <hi>Concealment</hi> of the ſenſe of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> which is as ſeriouſly aimed at in the frame thereof as the <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>Revealment.</hi> And the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector's mind ſeems to be caught and entangled in this ſnare.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To the fourth I anſwer, That Chriſt tells <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> in his Epiſtle to her (which is ſuppoſed to be directed to her <hi>in being,</hi> as the nature of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle requires) Behold, I have ſet before <hi>thee</hi> an <hi>open</hi> door, and no man can ſhut it. The vulgar Latine has moſt faithfully and skilfully tranſlated this paſſage out of the Greek, <hi>Ecce dedi coram te oſtium apertum,</hi> &amp;c. Where <hi>coram,</hi> as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Greek, is point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blank againſt the ſenſe the Objector would put upon the paſſage, as if Chriſt meant, that <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> yet was not arrived to this opened door, but that the Church at large in ſome time ſhould be, whenas the ſaying is expreſly directed to <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> to that <hi>very Interval</hi> of the Church. And it is ſaid, <hi>Dedi coram</hi> te <hi>oſtium apertum,</hi> That I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:34043:257"/>
                  <hi>thee Philadelphia,</hi> an open door in thy <hi>very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> not at a <hi>diſtance.</hi> For <hi>Coram</hi> fignifies <hi>proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> always, though <hi>Ante</hi> may be ſometimes uſed of that which is more diſtant. So plain is it, that the Objector's Expoſition is a falſe Gloſs on the Text. And whereas, he ſaith, we have in the next Epiſtle Chriſt knocking at <hi>this</hi> door (for what other can it be?) to get it open; I anſwer, it is impoſſible it ſhould be <hi>this</hi> door. For <hi>this</hi> door is an <hi>open</hi> door which no man could ſhut, unleſs Chriſt himſelf, and when he had once ſet it open to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> it is not likely he would ſhut it again to make himſelf needleſs work. Beſides, that this door in the Epiſtle to <hi>Laodicea</hi> is a door that <hi>others</hi> are to <hi>open</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> not the door <hi>he</hi> opens to <hi>others.</hi> Which alſo argues it cannot be the door in the entrance of <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. For no man opens that door in Heaven. But the door that Chriſt knocks at in his Epiſtle to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> is a door that <hi>men</hi> are to <hi>open</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> that he may come and ſup with them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore ſurely the Text does not intimate theſe <hi>three</hi> doors to be the <hi>ſame.</hi> But the firſt door, in the Epiſtle to <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> is a <hi>Political</hi> door, a door of ſure ſucceſs ſet open to them of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in their adminiſtration of the affairs of the Kingdom of Chriſt. The door in the Epiſtle to <hi>Laodicea</hi> is an <hi>Ethical</hi> door, the Hearts or Wills of the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> which Chriſt ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cits that they would open to him, and ſo receive him in the Communion of his Spirit, which is extremely well agreeing with all thoſe <hi>Moral</hi> Exhortations and Increpations preceding this paſſage. And laſtly, That door opened in the entrance of <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. is a <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> door, thorough which <hi>John</hi> paſſing, is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to behold <hi>Divine Viſions,</hi> and be a Witneſs of
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:34043:257"/>Chriſt's receiving from his Father, and revealing the following Prophecies touching the affairs of his Church to the end of the World. This is the eaſie and natural ſenſe of theſe <hi>three</hi> doors from the very Text of each place to him that will not <hi>Nodum in ſcirpo quaerere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. To the fifth I ſay, That if the Throne exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. be intended for <hi>Chriſt's Throne,</hi> which be promiſes the <hi>Victor</hi> at the end of the foregoing Chapter, the Scene ſeems to be very ill contrived. For he that ſits upon the Throne is <hi>not Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> nor does Chriſt or the ſlain Lamb ſo much as ſit with him on that Throne, but ſtands <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>betwixt</hi> the Throne (with Him that ſits on it) and the four Beaſts and Elders. And <hi>v.</hi> 7. being in this ſtanding poſture, he is ſaid to <hi>go</hi> and take the Book out of the right hand of Him that ſat upon the Throne. And ſo not ſo much as <hi>Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> is enthronized on this Throne, much leſs any <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicean</hi> Victor, which ſhould have been expreſſed in this Scene, if there were any ſuch real Connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this Viſion and that of the Viſion of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which the Objector is ſo ſolicitous for. There ſeems ſo great a diſſimilitude in the very <hi>Cortex,</hi> that it will not ſo much as afford a <hi>Lemmatoſynechia,</hi> that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial <hi>Blind,</hi> as I may ſo call it, at which I obſerved above, how incident the Objector is to ſtumble.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This ſixth Argument ſeems the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any, but I hope I ſhall offer that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſatisfactory in anſwer thereto, to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Reader. And becauſe the main ground of the ſtrength thereof is the Rule I have noted on <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 11. we will here produce the Rule, which is this, That the promiſe to the Victor preceding the
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:34043:258"/>Parabolical <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> is of things External and Political; but thoſe promiſes that follow the ſaid <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> are of things ſpiritual and inviſible. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I will only advertiſe, that the main <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> I intended lyes betwixt <hi>Viſibility</hi> and <hi>Inviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to us men of the performance of the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; though the things are ordinarily ſuch as may be alſo called <hi>Political.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence I anſwer firſt, That this promiſe of an Heavenly Throne being to be performed at that <hi>viſible</hi> and conſpicuous, nay <hi>glorious</hi> and illuſtrious general Aſſizes at the laſt Day, when the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God, and when the Believers that remain alive ſhall be caught up in the Clouds to meet the Lord in the Air; when he ſhall ſit upon the Throne of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and all Nations ſhall be gathered before him, whom he ſhall diſtinguiſh into ſheep and goats, and give the ſheep the Kingdom prepared for them, but condemn the Goats to everlaſting Fire: Is not this a performance, viſible in the higheſt meaſure, of that promiſe of Chriſt to him that overcomes, that he will grant to him to ſit with him in his Throne, even as he alſo overcame, and was ſet down with his Father in his? According to that in our Church Hymn; <hi>When thou hadſt overcome the ſharpneſs of death, thou didſt open the Kingdom of Heaven to all Believers.</hi> Into which queſtionleſs all true Believers enter at their death, but in a way <hi>inviſible,</hi> and therefore the promiſe of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> to him that overcame in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Church, is ſet after the <hi>Epiphomena.</hi> But this Heavenly Throne here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Victor being to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:34043:258"/>ſo <hi>viſibly</hi> in that great and general Aſſizes at the laſt Day, is placed according to the Rule before the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> thereby to advertiſe us, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to be performed at that great and ſolemn Day (which cloſeth the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Interval) in the ſight of all the World by Chriſt ſitting on his Throne of Glory with all Nations gathered before him.</p>
               <p>But now in the ſecond place, if you be ſo curious as not to be content that the reward and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance be viſible, but that it muſt needs be <hi>Political</hi> too, does not Chriſt ſay to the ſheep, Inherit the <hi>Kingdom</hi> prepared for you? And is not a <hi>Kingdom Political,</hi> and therefore the promiſe thereof <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal?</hi> Beſides what I intimated on this very Text, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.21. in theſe words. Nay you ſhall ſit with me on my Throne, and judge the Apoſtate Angels at the laſt Day. Nor them alone, but as Co-aſſeſſors with Chriſt on this <hi>Laodicean</hi> Throne, they ſhall judge all the guilty people gathered before the Throne of Chriſt at the Day of Judgment: And is not this then manifeſtly a promiſe of what is not only <hi>viſible,</hi> but alſo <hi>Political,</hi> and withal clear that there was all the reaſon in the World, that this promiſe ſhould be, as it is, placed before the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> and not after it? And this, I think, is a full and ſatisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this ſixth Argument, that from the placing of the promiſe of a Throne to the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Victor before the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> would infer, that it is an <hi>Earthly</hi> Throne, becauſe the placing thereof thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>Political,</hi> whenas this <hi>Heavenly Throne</hi> is manifeſtly ſo likewiſe.</p>
               <p>And that it is an <hi>Heavenly</hi> Throne, and not an <hi>Earthly</hi> (as we have plainly ſhown this ſixth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove nothing to the contrary, ſo) there
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:34043:259"/>are many Arguments for it, and ſuch as no man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed with prejudice but will thereby be readily aſſured of the truth thereof. As (1) The general conſent of Expoſitors. (2) The ſtate of the <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans,</hi> who are deſcribed under no ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the <hi>Smyrnean, Pergamenian, Thyatirian</hi> and <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Churches, who living under other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, were ſubject to <hi>Martyrdoms, Perſecutions,</hi> and great <hi>Hardſhips,</hi> and therefore thoſe and the <hi>few Names</hi> in <hi>Sardis,</hi> having for this very cauſe an <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Political</hi> promiſe made to them, there being no ſuch ground for them of <hi>Laodicea</hi> to have ſo, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a contrary condition, in <hi>peace, plenty</hi> and <hi>eaſe,</hi> inſomuch that they <hi>themſelves</hi> conceive they have need of nothing, this is a plain indication that no ſuch <hi>earthly Political</hi> promiſe is made to them, they enjoying it already. (3) All thoſe <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Exhortations and Increpations which tend to the fitting them for Heaven, and which ſhow them that only true and neceſſary way thither, theſe are ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intimation that the promiſe to the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Victor is that of an <hi>Heavenly</hi> Throne, not an <hi>earthly,</hi> which they enjoy'd already, wanting nothing. But the great ſolicitude of Chriſt ſeems here, to be to fit them for <hi>that</hi> ſtate. Whence he ſays after all theſe ſharp reproofs, <hi>As many as I love I rebuke and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, be zealous therefore and repent. Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock,</hi> &amp;c. This is all an urgency for the preparing themſelves for that <hi>Heavenly</hi> Throne, the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Doom</hi> being ſo near at hand. (4) And laſtly, The very words of the promiſe imply it is an <hi>Heavenly</hi> Throne, as the Method he ſo earneſtly commends to them, tends thereto: <hi>To him that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:34043:259"/>as I alſo overcame and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne: i. e.</hi> As Chriſt, when he had overcome the <hi>ſharpneſs</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> was <hi>advanced</hi> to the right hand of God in <hi>Heaven</hi> by the gift of his Father, ſo he having thus opened the Kingdom of <hi>Heaven</hi> to all true Believers, he that overcomes in that <hi>Moral</hi> ſenſe, ſhall have an <hi>Heavenly</hi> Throne of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> giving, all judgment, as it is ſaid, being committed to the Son. And it is very harſh that <hi>Chriſt's Throne</hi> after <hi>his</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming ſhould be <hi>Heavenly,</hi> and the <hi>Laodicean Victors Earthly,</hi> and not of the ſame kind, though of a leſs degree. This is certainly the genuine ſenſe of the promiſe of this <hi>Throne,</hi> to any one that is not blinded or biaſſed with ſome ſtrange prejudice. And this would have been the ſenſe, if the promiſe had been placed after the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> and not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant with our Hypotheſis, that the <hi>Laodicean</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval is the <hi>laſt</hi> Interval reaching to the end of the World, which is ſufficiently proved from other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. But the promiſe being placed before the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> it is not only <hi>not repugnant to,</hi> but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms</hi> our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that <hi>Laodicea</hi> is that <hi>Interval</hi> that takes in the laſt <hi>Judgment,</hi> when in a <hi>viſible</hi> manner all people are to be <hi>judged,</hi> as the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. The <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>rewards</hi> ſhall be <hi>viſible</hi> in the ſight of all the World. So fittingly do all things fall in with the truth of our <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> But I may ſeem to have dwelt too long upon my Anſwer to this ſixth Argument. We proceed to the ſeventh and laſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To this ſeventh and laſt therefore I ſay, That unleſs we ſuffer our Phancy to ſtick to the mere <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex</hi> of the figurative <hi>Letter</hi> which puts <hi>Throne</hi> for a <hi>Kingdom</hi> here, and the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Judicature,</hi> which
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:34043:260"/>is the real and genuine ſenſe, this Argument will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have ſmall ſtrength in it. For then ſuppoſing what I take to be true, that it is the promiſe of an <hi>Heavenly Kingdom;</hi> to ſit <hi>with Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Throne</hi> is to partake of <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom</hi> given to him by his Father, when he had overcome the ſharpneſs of Death; which Kingdom is plainly <hi>Heavenly,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon exalted to the right hand of God in Heaven, from whence he is to come viſibly at the laſt Day to judge the quick and the dead. For the Father judgeth no man, but has committed all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Son, as I noted above. And therefore <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. he ſaith to the ſheep on his right hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, <hi>inherit</hi> the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. Which <hi>Kingdom</hi> is ſo large, that <hi>Myriads</hi> may partake thereof without <hi>ſitting in Chriſt's lap,</hi> as the Objector's Argument inſinuates Chriſt to ſit in his <hi>Father's lap:</hi> and ſo all that partake of this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdom, to be as high in Heaven as God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Son Chriſt are, whenas they are not of equal Sovereignty, though the Throne were ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Earthly.</hi> So that this Sophiſtry would exclude the Victor from having any Throne at all.</p>
               <p>But that one and the ſame Throne in this groſs ſenſe is not meant, appears from the expreſſion of the ſame thing, or one part or Specimen thereof the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Judicature, Matt.</hi> 19. where Chriſt tells his Apoſtles, that at the Reſurrection they ſhall ſit upon <hi>twelve Thrones</hi> judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael, viz.</hi> at that time when all Nations ſhall be gathered together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt's Throne of Glory, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. and yet all theſe thirteen Thrones are but one Throne in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid ſignification of <hi>Throne,</hi> that is, the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Judicature.</hi> Which in a meaſure as it is there promiſed
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:34043:260"/>to the Apoſtles, ſo here to the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Victor, whoſe Priviledge it will be to judge alſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate <hi>Angels</hi> at the laſt Day, as the Apoſtle tells us 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. And I little queſtion but that this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge is included in a particular manner in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of an Heavenly Throne to the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Victor, the placing the promiſe before the <hi>Epiphonema</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating it to be <hi>viſible,</hi> which cannot be but at the laſt Day. From whence, as from other Arguments, it is plain, that the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Interval is the <hi>laſt</hi> time of the Church upon Earth, elſe why ſhould ſuch a promiſe be made to the <hi>Laodicean Victor,</hi> rather than to any other Victor in the ſeven Churches?</p>
               <p>And now I hope by this time it is plain, that though there be a pretty ſpeciouſneſs of Wit and quickneſs of Invention in the ſeven Arguments of the ingenious Objector, yet there is no real ſtrength in any of them, to prove that the Intervals of the ſeven Churches do not reach to the End of the World.</p>
               <p>I will only add from the ſame ingenious Hand what is objected againſt our Interpretation of <hi>Apoc.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 6. in the Notes (In the midſt of the Throne, and round about the Throne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereto, and then conclude. We ſuppoſe the <hi>Perimeter</hi> of the Throne to be ſquare. Let the ſquare <hi>Area</hi> be divided into four equal Squares by two Lines cutting themſelves <hi>ad angulos rectos</hi> in the Center of the ſaid large ſquare <hi>Area</hi> on which the Throne ſtands, and let each Line at both ends be produced ſomething beyond the <hi>Perimeter</hi> of this <hi>Area.</hi> Now according to the order of the Narration of the Text as well as the order of the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> let theſe twenty four <hi>crowned</hi> Elders, <hi>ſix</hi> on a ſide, <hi>three</hi> on one fide of the <hi>decuſſant</hi> Line, and <hi>three</hi> on the other
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:34043:261"/>ſide, on each ſide of the <hi>Perimeter</hi> be ſo equidiſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed, that every ſix Elders will take up a whole ſide, thus plainly <hi>environing</hi> the whole <hi>Perimeter</hi> of the Throne, and ſo properly to be ſaid to be <hi>round about</hi> it. This anſwers to what is declared <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.4. And <hi>round about</hi> the <hi>Throne</hi> were four and twenty Seats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now let us conceive the <hi>four Beaſts,</hi> which in the Viſion are but <hi>ſingle</hi> Beaſts placed on thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>decuſſant</hi> Lines which divide each ſide of the <hi>Perimeter</hi> in the <hi>midſt,</hi> a little more removed from the <hi>Perimeter</hi> than the <hi>Seats</hi> of the Elders. Here it cannot be ſaid ſo roundly (becauſe there is but a <hi>ſingle</hi> Beaſt on each ſide of the <hi>Perimeter</hi> of the Throne) that they were <hi>round about</hi> it in the ſame ſenſe the Elders are ſaid to be. But they ſtanding on theſe Lines that divide each ſide of the <hi>Perimeter</hi> of the Throne in the <hi>midſt,</hi> they are ſaid to be in the <hi>midſt</hi> of the <hi>Throne,</hi> and <hi>round about</hi> the <hi>Throne.</hi> In the <hi>Midſt</hi> for the reaſon aboveſaid, and <hi>round about</hi> it, becauſe every ſide of the <hi>Perimeter</hi> has a Beaſt juſt againſt the <hi>midſt</hi> thereof. This is the clear and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid reaſon why Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> interprets <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more than that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that they were in the <hi>midſt</hi> of each ſide of the <hi>Perimeter round about, no ſide</hi> excepted.</p>
               <p>But this Explication, ſays the ingenious Objector, is encumbred with theſe two difficulties. One is, that by this account the <hi>Elders</hi> will be in the <hi>midst</hi> of the <hi>Throne too,</hi> whoſe place is only ſaid to have been <hi>round about</hi> the Throne. The other is, that it will not be eaſily granted that any thing can be ſaid to be in the <hi>midſt</hi> of the <hi>circumference</hi> of any figure,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:34043:261"/>which is neither <hi>in</hi> it, nor <hi>within</hi> it. But to the firſt I anſwer, That none of the equidiſtant <hi>Seats</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> can be ſaid to be in the <hi>midſt</hi> of the <hi>Perimeter</hi> of the Throne in that <hi>exact</hi> ſenſe that the <hi>Beaſts</hi> may be ſaid ſo to be. And beſides, they ſo perfectly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding the Throne, there was no occaſion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to uſe any ſuch expreſſion of being in the <hi>midſt</hi> of any thing. And to the ſecond I briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That as the <hi>Elders</hi> are eaſily conceived to ſit <hi>round about</hi> the exteriour <hi>Perimeter</hi> of the Throne, ſo the <hi>four Beaſts</hi> to ſtand <hi>at</hi> the <hi>midſt</hi> of each ſide of the ſaid <hi>Perimeter.</hi> For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> need ſignifie no more than ſo. The Prepoſitions <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifie not only <hi>[In]</hi> but <hi>[Propter]</hi> or <hi>[Prope]</hi> as our learned Objector cannot but know very well. And thus, I hope, this ſomething perplexing paſſage of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> is fully cleared, and the right of <hi>Precedency</hi> in the <hi>crowned</hi> Elders before the four Beaſts, the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> juſtly retrieved and confirmed.</p>

               <head>CHAP. L. <hi>A brief Method of demonſtrating how there may be</hi> three <hi>and</hi> no more <hi>than</hi> three <hi>real Hypoſtaſes or Perſons in the</hi> One <hi>Divine Subſtance or Eſſence.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FOR the more clearly proceeding in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are firſt to define the Terms thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> what is meant by <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or <hi>Perſon,</hi> what by the <hi>Divine Subſtance</hi> or Eſſence, what by being <hi>One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the firſt we are to obſerve, That <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuum, Suppoſitum, Hypoſtaſis</hi> or <hi>Perſona</hi> taken in the <hi>Abſtract,</hi> are mere <hi>Logical Notions</hi> applicable, the firſt to any <hi>ſingular</hi> Being, whether <hi>Subſtance</hi> or <hi>Accident;</hi> The ſecond to any <hi>complete</hi> Subſtance at leaſt; The third, <hi>viz. Hypoſtaſis</hi> or <hi>Perſona</hi> to any <hi>intelligent</hi> Eſſence or Subſtance. And therefore where theſe <hi>Logical Notions</hi> are applied, there is ſome <hi>ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Thing,</hi> Accident, Subſtance, or intelligent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to which they are applied, or elſe they remain no more than mere <hi>Logical Notions,</hi> ſuch as they were before the Application.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>Divine Eſſence</hi> or Subſtance; What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Subſtance exiſts eternally, neceſſarily and <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> of another, and is <hi>infinitely</hi> wiſe, good and powerful, and from whom the whole Creation does exiſt, and by whom it does continue and ſubſiſt, this is aſſuredly an <hi>Eſſence</hi> or Subſtance <hi>truly Divine,</hi> and ſuch as deſerves all Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Adoration from the whole Creation that are capable of rendring it.</p>
               <p>And now thirdly and laſtly for the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:34043:262"/>
                  <hi>Divine Eſſence</hi> or Subſtance; Whatever Subſtance, whether Divine or not Divine, is <hi>Ens unum per ſe, &amp; non per aliud,</hi> is as much <hi>one</hi> Subſtance (as to Subſtance) as any Subſtance can be. For ſuch a Subſtance has no compoſition at all of <hi>integrant</hi> parts, and can no more be <hi>diſcerped</hi> and diſſevered one part from another than a mere Phyſical or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical <hi>Monad,</hi> if there be any ſuch, but is one inſeparably and indiviſibly. And ſuch an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> or <hi>Oneneſs</hi> as this we affirm to be in that <hi>Singular</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence or Subſtance, of whom the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>inviſible</hi> doth depend.</p>
               <p>We proceed from the <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Terms</hi> to the propoſing of ſome few <hi>Axioms,</hi> ſuch as no unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Underſtanding will eaſily deny.</p>
               <p>The firſt, That there is <hi>but one God,</hi> and that the ſame is a Subſtance or Eſſence <hi>infinitely,</hi> or moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely <hi>perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond, That this <hi>Oneneſs</hi> of the Deity, and <hi>abſolute</hi> Perfection thereof does forbid, The <hi>former,</hi> that any <hi>Multiplicity</hi> ſhould be admitted that did not conſiſt with, or were not in order to the diſcovery of the moſt <hi>abſolute</hi> Perfection in the Deity; The <hi>latter</hi> forbids that any <hi>Multiplicity</hi> be <hi>rejected</hi> that makes for that <hi>abſolute</hi> and conſummate <hi>Perfection</hi> in the Deity, provided that it does conſiſt with that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Subſtance</hi> or Eſſence deſcribed in the <hi>third</hi> Definition.</p>
               <p>The third, That God cannot be infinitely or <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely</hi> perfect without the <hi>perception of himſelf,</hi> and that Joy and Love that reſults therefrom in finding himſelf that full, free, and abſolute <hi>unſelf-intereſſed Good,</hi> ſuch as he is in his eternal and immutable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <pb n="466" facs="tcp:34043:263"/>
               <p>The fourth, That <hi>any Perception</hi> of himſelf, or Love and Joy in himſelf, is not enough to complete his <hi>moſt abſolute Perfection,</hi> but it muſt be a <hi>Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>moſt perfect</hi> kind.</p>
               <p>The fifth, That <hi>Eſſential</hi> Perception and <hi>Eſſential</hi> Love is a far more excellent Perception and Love, than that which is <hi>Modal,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Creatures</hi> are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. But it is the Priviledge of the Deity to perceive by an <hi>Eſſential Perception,</hi> and to love by an <hi>Eſſential Love; Per</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and not <hi>per ſpeciem,</hi> as <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> ſpeaks. God's <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perception</hi> of himſelf is not by a <hi>Modal</hi> Image of himſelf, but by a <hi>Subſtantial</hi> Repreſentation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within himſelf more ſubſtantial than his <hi>Conceptus ad extra,</hi> which yet the whole Creation of things viſible and inviſible really is, <hi>viz.</hi> one <hi>ſubſtantial Thought</hi> iſſuing from the Divinity. We may expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in our ſelves how imperfect our Perception is of our own ſelves; Foraſmuch as we perceive not the <hi>very Eſſence</hi> or Subſtance of our Souls at all, but merely <hi>Phantaſms</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> which are not the <hi>Soul it ſelf,</hi> which is a <hi>permanent</hi> Being, but theſe paſs away perpetually in <hi>ſucceſſion.</hi> We ſeem to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Body</hi> more perfectly, it being a Subſtance our Soul is nearly united to and ſteadily preſent with us, and that ſo lively and feelingly, that the Vulgar take their <hi>Body</hi> to be <hi>themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixth, The power of creating argues a <hi>vaſt Perfection</hi> in the Deity, and to be a Creature as <hi>vaſt</hi> an <hi>imperfection,</hi> in reſpect of God.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh, The <hi>exteriour</hi> Creation is uncapable of being <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> nor is it any defect in the Deity, but in the nature of the Creature, that it cannot exiſt from all Eternity.</p>
               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:34043:263"/>
               <p>The eighth, In the <hi>Fountain</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> whom we call, the <hi>Father,</hi> there is not only <hi>himſelf,</hi> but the whole <hi>exteriour</hi> Creation, <hi>Eminently, Cauſally,</hi> and <hi>Ideally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ninth, Though the <hi>exteriour</hi> Creation could not be <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> yet there not only could be, but <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>unavoidably</hi> was an <hi>Eternal Generation</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> who is the <hi>Eradiation</hi> of the glorious Richneſs and Fulneſs of his Father, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, which plainly imports no empty <hi>Logical Notion,</hi> but a <hi>real</hi> ſecond <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The tenth, The Father containing in himſelf the whole <hi>exteriour</hi> Creation, and the <hi>Son</hi> being the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image</hi> of his Perſon, does <hi>ipſo facto</hi> contain in himſelf alſo the <hi>Ideal</hi> or <hi>Archetypal</hi> World <hi>ab aeterno.</hi> So that although there could be no <hi>exteriour</hi> Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ab aeterno</hi> yet this <hi>interiour</hi> Generation of the Son does more than compenſate that Defect, and takes away the Imputation of an Eternal ſolitude and ſterility from the Deity. Which therefore argues the greater perfection thereof in this regard alſo, Axiom 6.</p>
               <p>The eleventh, Moreover, this ſecond <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> being the <hi>expreſs Image</hi> of his Father's Fulneſs, <hi>God of God,</hi> or a Divine <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> from a Divine <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis,</hi> here is another Argument of the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divinity, <hi>viz.</hi> the moſt <hi>perfect kind</hi> of <hi>Perception</hi> of <hi>himſelf;</hi> That it is not <hi>per ſpeciem,</hi> but <hi>per</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>per ipſam rei praeſentiam,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fifth Axiom.</p>
               <p>The twelfth, And ſo for the ſame reaſon, that the <hi>Love</hi> whereby God loves himſelf or joys in himſelf,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:34043:264"/>may be of the <hi>most perfect kind,</hi> it is not to be <hi>per operationem</hi> or <hi>ſpeciem,</hi> but <hi>per</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be <hi>eſſential,</hi> or <hi>per ipſam rei praeſentiam.</hi> Which therefore requires a <hi>third Hypoſtaſis,</hi> whoſe <hi>eſſential Character</hi> is <hi>Divine Love</hi> or Joy, and iſſues eternally from the grateful Perception that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son have of one another. This <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> proceeding, whether from the <hi>Father,</hi> as the <hi>Greek</hi> Church would have it, or from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> as the <hi>Latine,</hi> (which to me ſeems the more rational and agreeable to Scripture) his joyous <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame,</hi> as I may ſo ſpeak, is the more highly kindled by the Perception of that <hi>exulting Complacency</hi> the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>ſecond Hypoſtaſes</hi> have in one another, as both alſo in him. For whatever is felt in <hi>one Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis</hi> is felt in all <hi>three,</hi> by reaſon of their thorough and ſolid Union, and that with the moſt <hi>perfect kind</hi> of <hi>Perception,</hi> the <hi>Hypoſtaſes themſelves</hi> feeling, as I may ſo ſay, and intimately perceiving how it is with <hi>themſelves</hi> in feeling how it is with one another. Wherefore we ſee manifeſt reaſon why there ſhould be <hi>three Hypoſtaſes</hi> in the Deity, becauſe they tend to the <hi>perfection</hi> thereof, that it may have the moſt <hi>perfect Perception</hi> of it ſelf, and the moſt <hi>perfect Love</hi> of and Joy in it ſelf, <hi>viz.,</hi> that they be not merely <hi>per Speciem</hi> or <hi>Operationem,</hi> but <hi>Eſſential,</hi> as is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deducible out of the third, fourth and fifth Axioms, to ſay nothing of the ſixth, ſeventh, eighth, ninth and tenth. Out of which we underſtand that the <hi>Eternal Generation</hi> of the Son comprizeth alſo in it the <hi>Archetypal World ab aeterno,</hi> though the <hi>exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> Creation was uncapable of that Priviledge, and that the Spirit, the immediate Mover in the <hi>exteriour</hi> Creation, was eternally <hi>impregnated</hi> from the Son as
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:34043:264"/>
                  <hi>he actuated</hi> from his <hi>Father,</hi> whence proceeded the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and nothing but the <hi>incapacity</hi> of the <hi>Creature</hi> was a lett from <hi>its</hi> exiſting from all Eternity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the acknowledging a <hi>Trinity</hi> in the <hi>Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Perfection</hi> therein upon this account alſo, and takes the imputation, as I hinted before, of an <hi>Eternal ſterility</hi> and ſolitude in the Deity. And therefore this <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> in the <hi>Deity</hi> is not to be rejected by the ſecond part of Axiom the ſecond.</p>
               <p>But now that there are <hi>no more</hi> than <hi>three</hi> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſes in the Deity, may appear from the <hi>first</hi> part of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Axiom that advertiſeth us, that the <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> is ſo ſacred and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally acknowledged by the Principles of humane Reaſon, that no more <hi>multiplicity</hi> is to be admitted therein than conſiſteth with and tendeth to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfection;</hi> which being completed in every regard by theſe ſuppoſed <hi>three</hi> Hypoſtaſes, there is a neceſſary <hi>ſtop</hi> given in our Reaſon from admitting <hi>any more,</hi> no not ſo much as a fourth, there being no reaſon to be given for the admittance of a fourth but what will with like validity infer four thouſand, nay four millions of Hypoſtaſes, or rather an Infinity of them. Which is ſo <hi>groſs</hi> and <hi>wild</hi> a Conceit, that there is no wiſe and ſober man but will explode it at firſt ſight. <hi>Fruſtra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora,</hi> is a Maxim of <hi>univerſal</hi> Truth. And the perfect <hi>Symmetry,</hi> as I may ſo ſpeak, <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Congruity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> or Eſſence is ſuch, that it cannot admit of any ſuch uncouth ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It is the Priviledge of the <hi>abſolute Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature to be thus unexceptionably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, as having no other Author or Cauſe of it
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:34043:265"/>ſelf but it ſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> the reaſon of its <hi>Exiſtence</hi> and <hi>Eſſence,</hi> ſuch as it is, is reſolvible only into the <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Excellency</hi> of its <hi>own</hi> Nature or Idea.</p>
               <p>This plauſible Plea humane Reaſon, if need were, might offer in behalf of <hi>three</hi> Hypoſtaſes, and <hi>no more</hi> than <hi>three</hi> in the <hi>Divine Eſſence.</hi> But the <hi>Triunity</hi> of the Godhead being an <hi>ancient</hi> ſolemn and Divine <hi>Tradition,</hi> embraced not only by the Church of God, but by the beſt and <hi>divineſt</hi> Philoſophers of old, whether we have rendred <hi>punctually</hi> and <hi>particularly</hi> the very reaſons of <hi>three</hi> Hypoſtaſes and <hi>no more,</hi> or not; yet it is <hi>indubitable</hi> but that in the <hi>general</hi> we have not erred, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Godhead was moſt <hi>abſolutely completed</hi> in <hi>theſe three,</hi> though we cannot give the account ſo particularly and preciſely, and that therefore there was no more. And Ingenuity and Modeſty may well acquieſce in this <hi>general</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis touching ſo profound and unſearchable a Myſtery. And ſcarce any, I think, would have he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated touching this Divine Tradition, if they could have reconciled theſe <hi>three real</hi> Hypoſtaſes, not <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Notions</hi> (according to the firſt Definition) with the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Godhead, that is, if they could have made out, that there is no Repugnancy in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, That there are <hi>three real</hi> Hypoſtaſes in <hi>one ſingular</hi> or <hi>individual</hi> and <hi>indiviſible</hi> Divine <hi>Eſſence</hi> or Subſtance; which one <hi>ſingular</hi> and <hi>indiviſible</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Subſtance</hi> is that one God (according as it is deſcribed in the ſecond Definition) of whom the whole Creation depends.</p>
               <p>But now that there is no repugnancy in this, I think I may ſay is <hi>demonſtrable;</hi> and that in a few words and from Principles acknowledged by all, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Generation of the Son is not <hi>arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly</hi>
                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:34043:265"/>or <hi>precariouſly dependent</hi> on the Father, but that it is the very Priviledge of his Nature to be <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, unavoidably</hi> and <hi>eternally</hi> generated of him by an <hi>Emanative</hi> Generation, as he is called by the Apoſtle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Eradiation</hi> of his Father's Glory. And ſo none will queſtion but that the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth either from the Father, or from the Father and the Son, by an <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native</hi> Proceſſion: Nor can any Wit of man imagine why the production of one ſhould be <hi>emanative,</hi> and not the other. Now the nature of what is <hi>emanative</hi> from another is this, (whether it be <hi>Mode</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>) That as it is not that <hi>adequately</hi> from which it does emane, but ſomething ſome way <hi>diſtinct</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, elſe <hi>nothing</hi> did emane, and there would be <hi>no Emanation;</hi> ſo that which does emane thus <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily</hi> is as <hi>inſeparably one</hi> and <hi>indiviſibly</hi> with that from whence it doth emane, as the parts, if I may ſo ſpeak, of any Subſtance <hi>incorporeal,</hi> which is <hi>Ens unum per ſe &amp; non per aliud.</hi> So that if that which does <hi>emane</hi> is <hi>Subſtance</hi> from <hi>Subſtance,</hi> they are both <hi>as much</hi> one Subſtance, as to Subſtance, <hi>as</hi> any <hi>one</hi> Subſtance can be, according to our third Definition. Inſomuch that according to this account of the <hi>three</hi> Hypoſtaſes, the ſecond and third iſſuing from the firſt by an <hi>eternal, neceſſary</hi> and unavoidable <hi>Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> not <hi>arbitrariouſly</hi> or <hi>precariouſly</hi> (which is the proper Character of <hi>Creation,</hi> the Creature having but a precarious Exiſtence) <hi>all</hi> theſe <hi>three</hi> real Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſes are as much <hi>one ſingular Divine Eſſence</hi> or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by definition the ſecond, as <hi>any</hi> Subſtance can be. From whence it plainly follows, that though there be <hi>three</hi> Hypoſtaſes, in the <hi>Divine Subſtance</hi> ſo deſcribed in the ſecond Definition, yet that Divine
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:34043:266"/>Subſtance being as perfectly <hi>one</hi> as any Subſtance can be, that yet there is but <hi>one God,</hi> which is the thing that was to be demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>Which plain account is a Key that will unlock the hardeſt difficulties in the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed touching the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Godhead. I will give one Inſtance for all; where it is ſaid, The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghoſt is God, yet there are not three Gods, but one God. If any one ſhould here object that nothing can be <hi>God</hi> but what is <hi>Divine Subſtance,</hi> and that if the <hi>Divine Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> be the <hi>ſole adequate</hi> Subſtance for the <hi>whole Trinity</hi> of the Hypoſtaſes, the <hi>ſecond</hi> and the <hi>third</hi> Hypoſtaſes will be empty <hi>Logical Notions</hi> according to Definition the firſt: but if they be <hi>real</hi> Hypoſtaſes, there will be <hi>three Divine Subſtances,</hi> whatever is ſaid truly to be God, being a Divine Subſtance: I ſay ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this account, we may ſafely and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pronounce, that the Father is a Divine Subſtance, the Son a Divine Subſtance, and the Holy Ghoſt a Divine Subſtance, yet there are not <hi>three Divine Subſtances,</hi> but <hi>one</hi> abſolute <hi>Divine Subſtance,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Definition the third, and ſo plainly but <hi>one God,</hi> though three Hypoſtaſes. Whoſe Union is ſuch, accordingly as has been deſcribed, that they make one <hi>ſingular</hi> or <hi>individual</hi> and <hi>indiviſible</hi> Divine Eſſence or Subſtance, nor admit of any <hi>ſingular</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature or Subſtance, excluding therefrom (or not including) themſelves. Foraſmuch as that <hi>fourth</hi> being a <hi>ſingular</hi> Divine Nature, would <hi>ipſo facto</hi> be an <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> by Definition the firſt, unleſs we can imagine a <hi>ſingular</hi> Divine Subſtance <hi>devoid</hi> of <hi>Intelligence.</hi> Whence it is manifeſt, that the above propoſed account is the moſt unexceptionable and
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:34043:266"/>intelligible that is, and the true account indeed how <hi>three real</hi> Hypoſtaſes are conſiſtent with <hi>one ſingular</hi> Divine Subſtance, that is, with <hi>one God.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>I Thought to have concluded my <hi>Paralipomena Prophetica</hi> with the immediately foregoing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter touching the <hi>Triunity</hi> of the <hi>Godhead.</hi> But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Letter ſent unto me written in favour of ſome paſſages in <hi>S. E. his Remarks</hi> before my <hi>Paralipomena</hi> were printed off, I thought it not amiſs to raiſe ſome <hi>Queries</hi> out of the ſame Letter, and anſwer to them, and ſo conclude all with theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 1. Whether in thoſe words <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.6. [That
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:34043:267"/>there ſhould be time no longer] [Time] there ſignifies the <hi>Political</hi> Order and Government of the World, and implies that in the <hi>Millennial</hi> ſtate all Humane Laws and <hi>Polities</hi> ſhall ceaſe, and the Government be carried on merely by the <hi>guidance</hi> of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and whether that Voice, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.17. from the Throne [It is done] and the ſame Voice, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.6. do not anſwer to, <hi>Time ſhould be no longer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The true ſenſe out of the Original of that latter Clauſe of <hi>Rev. Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 6. and of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verſe, is this, That there ſhall be no longer time ſaving in the days of the voice of the ſeventh Angel when he ſhall ſound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is made good in my <hi>Notes</hi> upon my Expoſition of that Chapter, and ſtill further confirmed by the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker</hi> on the place: So that no man of any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of Judgment can poſſibly deny the truth of that Expoſition. Wherefore if [Time] ſignifie the <hi>Political</hi> Order and Government of the World, we are aſſured by the Oath of the Angel that <hi>ſuch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> will continue all along the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, which reaches to the end of the World. For his ſwearing there will be no longer time, <hi>ſaving</hi> what the ſeventh Trumpet comprizeth, implies that [Time] which <hi>S. E.</hi> would have ſignifie <hi>Political Government,</hi> will continue all that Trumpet long. But now for the Voice [It is done] in thoſe places mentioned, how it can anſwer to this place, let any man of ſenſe conſider, unleſs it be ſuch an impertinent Anſwer as is perſtringed in that Proverb. Which the way to <hi>London?</hi> A poke full of Plums. The mentioned Voice [It is done] though <hi>Time</hi> here ſignified <hi>Political</hi> Order and Government, were nothing to the confirming that Notion. For <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.17.
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:34043:267"/>it ſignifies nothing but aſſurance of ſucceſs to the Miniſters of Chriſt's Kingdom under the ſeventh Vial. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.6. the aſſurance of the truth of the Prediction of the glorious appearance of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> on Earth. That the thing is as ſure as if it were done already, and therefore he preſently adds, I am <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> &amp;c. as intimating his ability certainly to effect it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 2. Whether the Plagues inflicted by the Witneſſes were not inflicted during their 1260 days propheſying, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.6. and therefore the ſame with the ſix firſt Plagues, there being no other actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inflicted Plagues prefigured but they. This is taken out of the <hi>Anſwer to the Remarks,</hi> pag. 119.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is made a Query, becauſe the above-mentioned Letter pretends Allegations againſt the truth of the Affirmative thereof; As that moſt of the firſt ſix Plagues were expired before the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes began to propheſie, and that alſo thoſe Plagues belong to the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Prophecy, which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying of the Witneſſes does not, and are inflicted by barbarous Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which I anſwer, That the propheſying of the Witneſſes and the ſix firſt Plagues or Trumpets are Synchronal according to Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and the Truth it ſelf, and therefore none of the Plagues could expire before the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes began to propheſie. And although the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying Witneſſes belong not to the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, yet being Synchronal to the <hi>first ſix Trumpets</hi> of the <hi>Sealed Book</hi>-Prophecy, they are ſo to the <hi>first ſix Plagues,</hi> and therefore falling in to the ſame time, bid fair for proving the Inflicters of the ſaid Plagues, and thoſe ſix to be the Plagues the Witneſſes are ſaid to inflict during the 1260 days of their propheſying,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:34043:268"/>in which they muſt inflict them or never. For the Scene of the Witneſſes goes off at the cloſe of the ſixth Trumpet. Nor do theſe firſt ſix Plagues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing executed by the barbarous Nations, hinder but that they may be inflicted by the Witneſſes in that way they inflict any Plagues, which, if <hi>poſitively,</hi> is only by denouncing them; as <hi>Jeremy</hi> is ſaid to <hi>do</hi> the things he <hi>denounces, Jer.</hi> 1.10. The Objector alſo ſeems not to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Witneſſes propheſying it ſelf, and the Plagues attending their propheſying, nor betwixt their <hi>Power</hi> of inflicting Plagues and their <hi>actually</hi> inflicting them. The thing therefore I ſay is this, That there is no other poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and actually inflicted Plagues prefigured, but thoſe contained under the firſt ſix Trumpets, to the cloſe of the ſixth whereof the Fall of the City and Riſing of the Witneſſes is referrible. Upon which it is ſaid <hi>the ſecond Wo is paſt,</hi> Chap. 11.14. And the Fall of the City or Converſion of ſo conſiderable a part of the Weſtern Empire to the pure Goſpel, is referrible to the effect of the fire proceeding out of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes mouths, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.5. according to my Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 3. Whether the opening the Temple, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.19. is juſt before the firſt Vial, but the time of the ſeeing the Ark there not till the ſixth Vial, whenas yet the opening the Temple was for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſhewing the Ark, and the ſight thereof the firſt thing related upon the opening the Temple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whoever reads conſiderately and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicedly the 23. Chapter of theſe <hi>Paralipomena,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be fully aſſured that what follows the <hi>Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi> of the <hi>Elders,</hi> Rev. 11. and the <hi>joyful Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi> of the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rev. 14. falls into the
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:34043:268"/>times of the Vials, and is a more broken and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous Repreſentation of them. Wherefore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as after the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> Rev. 15. (which anſwers to the <hi>Doxologie</hi> of the Elders and joyful <hi>Annunciation</hi> of the Fall of <hi>Babylon</hi>) the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Temple there <hi>v.</hi> 5. is in order to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the Vial-Angels, and there being no pouring forth of the Vials but by the Vial-Angels, nor they doing their work before they come out of the opened Temple, it is plain that the Temple was open or ſtood open before the firſt Vial, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. though the mention of its ſtanding open is not before the ſixth Vial, the opening of the Temple being not ſimply for the ſhewing the Ark, but for the going forth of the Vial-Angels. But the Temple ſtanding all this time open, the Ark is not ſaid to be ſeen till ſome time after, it denoting the time of the Calling of the Jews with whom God has made an everlaſting Covenant, as this Ark is the Ark of the Covenant. Nor is it ſaid that <hi>John</hi> ſaw this Ark, but it is ſaid indefinitely to be ſeen, the eyes of all at that time being to be caſt upon that Holy Covenant which God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed for ever, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God himſelf will have an eye to it then, and make good his glorious Promiſes to that long exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and afflicted people. Nor is the ſight of the Ark the firſt thing related upon the opening the Temple, but, though the Temple ſtood open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet it is not mentioned till now, the more to ſet off the richneſs of this diſcovery of God's Mercy towards the Jews, which the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> every where ſets ſuch an exceſſive value upon, as if this were ſuch a weighty <hi>Arcanum</hi> or Myſtery (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo calls it) that it were worth the opening the Temple,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:34043:269"/>though it were but for the diſcovery of that Myſtery <hi>alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 4. Whether what happens in the allotted times of the <hi>Trumpet-Angels</hi> and <hi>Vial-Angels,</hi> may be attributed to the Angel to whom the Time is allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether the Angel contribute any thing to it or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If we were ſure he did contribute nothing, and that ſuch a thing fell out, in his allotted time, as was plainly indicated in the Prophecy: Then by a Prophetick <hi>Metalepſis</hi> the thing ſo happening might be attributed to him, as the taking Peace from the Earth, is attributed to the Rider of the red Horſe under the <hi>ſecond Seal,</hi> becauſe in his time there was ſuch killing and ſlaying one another. But if the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel can be conceived to act <hi>poſitively,</hi> I confeſs it is more than needs to recur to that Figure. But to avoid all Cavil in reference to the <hi>first Vial-Angel,</hi> I allow a <hi>real</hi> Activity in him for the inflicting that angry <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Boil. So that as an evil Spirit from the Lord haunted <hi>Saul</hi> when his Melancholy fits came upon him; ſo this firſt <hi>Vial-Angel</hi> may commiſſionate ſome Spirits upon the envy and the anger the Beſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had conceived againſt the Riſen Witneſſes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate them with more than ordinary Rage and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt them, and ſo infatuate their Counſels by this diſtemper, as is anſwered to the <hi>Remarks</hi> on the place. The Objector would fain pinch ſomewhere, if he could find what to lay hold on. But <hi>effundit junctura ungues.</hi> The work is too cloſe wrought for him to find any entrance any where.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 5. In thoſe words, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.8. The fourth Angel poured out his Vial on the Sun, and Power was given him to ſcorch men with fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:34043:269"/>[him] relate to the <hi>Sun,</hi> or not rather to the <hi>Angel,</hi> the Sun being no Perſon to whom [Him] can relate, and beſides it being ſenſleſs to refer it to any other than the Angel who inflicts the Plague.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That [Him] ſhould be referred to the <hi>Sun,</hi> not to the <hi>Angel,</hi> there is all the Reaſon in the World, nor is there any Reaſon againſt it. For the calling the Sun [Him] makes him no perſon, no more in Engliſh than <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does in Greek. For <hi>Judg. Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 31. there it is ſaid, Let them that love the Lord be as the Sun when <hi>he</hi> goeth forth in his ſtrength; and ſo <hi>he</hi> or <hi>his</hi> is in ſo many other places ſaid of the Sun, as it is needleſs to recite. But why [Him] is to be referred to the <hi>Sun,</hi> there are plain and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reaſons. Firſt, Becauſe [Him] does immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the mention of the Sun. Secondly, The Reference is ſo natural, the Sun being ſuch a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Heat, and the heat thereof ſo invigorated by the effuſion of the fourth Vial on it. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Suffrage of all Interpreters I could ever meet with or hear of, concurs in this reference of [Him] to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and not to the <hi>Angel.</hi> So that it is moſt undubitably true, that [him] is to be referred not to the <hi>Angel,</hi> but to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and that it is a mere affected ſwaggering in the behalf of <hi>S. E.</hi> to ſay it is ſenſleſs to refer [him] to any other than the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</hi> Whence it is unavoidably evident, that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker</hi> is out in his ill-natur'd Gloſs on the <hi>fourth Vial,</hi> as if the ſcorched with that fiery heat, were thoſe that were zealouſly incenſed, and ſharply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed againſt the Antichriſtian Powers, which is a perfect contradiction to the Text, as if theſe <hi>Zelots</hi> ſcorched the <hi>Sun,</hi> whenas the Text plainly ſays the <hi>Sun</hi> ſcorched them, [him] being certainly referred
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:34043:270"/>to the <hi>Sun.</hi> And then ſuppoſe [him] to be referred to the <hi>Angel,</hi> and that he ſcorches the <hi>Zelots,</hi> and incenſes them againſt the Antichriſtian Powers, this is ſtill a perfect contradiction to the Text. For the Text ſays, thoſe <hi>ſcorched</hi> ones <hi>blaſphemed the Name of God,</hi> which the <hi>Remarker</hi> will not admit of his <hi>godly Zelots.</hi>

                  <hi>Query</hi> 6. Whether the Tripartite Forces gathered together in <hi>Armageddon</hi> under the <hi>Dragon,</hi> under the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> and under the <hi>Rider</hi> of the <hi>white Horſe</hi> that has the Sword coming out of his mouth, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Infidel, Antichriſtian</hi> and <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> Forces or Parties, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 16. may be repreſented alſo by the <hi>great City</hi> divided into <hi>three</hi> parts, <hi>v.</hi> 19. For how is it poſſible that three ſuch <hi>oppoſite</hi> Parties as the <hi>Infidel, Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> ſhould be repreſented by a City, which is a Body <hi>Politick, united</hi> by Laws and Rulers to govern the ſame; whenas thoſe three Parties are uncapable of being ſo united, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That thoſe Tripartite Forces are the Forces of the whole World, or a Conflux of the people of the whole World, may appear from <hi>v.</hi> 14.
