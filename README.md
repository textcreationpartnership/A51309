1. Paralipomena Prophetica.

    _ THE INTRODUCTION. The occaſion of the Author's writing his Paralipomena Prophetica. His deſign in writing them, to ſhow there is but one true way of interpreting Daniel and the Apocalypſe. How himſelf was diſcouraged in his younger days by the variety of Interpretations; with a ſolution of that fallacy. His Apologie for his great care and diligence in managing this Province of rightly interpreting the above ſaid Prophecies.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. I. Tho. Lydiat's Epocha of the twentieth of Artaxerxes Longimanus for the compute of Daniel's weeks more fully to be inſiſted on. Two undeniable Poſtulatums in order thereto. The paſſage of the Prophecy that reſpects the Epocha of the weeks. Four Decrees, but only two of them Competitors for the Epochate, viz. that of the ſeventh, and that of the twentieth of Artaxerxes, the one granted to Ezra, the other to Nehemiah. The Commiſſions granted to each, and ſome circumſtances of the execution of them. The comparing of them with the Epocha deſcribed in the Prophecy. That Nehemiah's nuncupatory Commiſſion does the more exactly agree with the ſaid deſcription. That the Jews had never any Decree to build the walls of Jeruſalem till that of Nehemiah. Further Arguments to the ſame purpoſe. In what ſenſe the City may be ſaid to be built before the Commiſſion of Nehemiah. An Anſwer to an Objection from thoſe words, Ezra 9.9. to give us a wall. Further Reaſons to prove that Ezra had no Commiſſion to build the walls of Jeruſalem. The teſtimony of the Son of Sirach. No Commiſſion but that of Nehemiah had the Title of building the walls. That it is ſo plain a caſe, that Nehemiah's Commiſſion is the true Epocha of the weeks, that learned men have betaken themſelves to Lunar years to compute by, rather than deſert it. The unſucceſsfulneſs of that device.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. II. Though Julius Africanus his Conceit for computing Daniel's Weeks by Lunar years, be witty, yet it is not true. That there is a neceſſity of computing by Solar years, as well as of retaining the Epocha of the twentieth of Artaxerxes: But withal of removing the Commencement of Artaxerxes his Reign higher in Chronologie than Chronologers uſually place it. Petavius his device of making Artaxerxes's Reign ten years with his Father, propoſed. An Examination of this Hypotheſis. The infirmneſs of the ground thereof out of Herodotus, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, not ſignifying, as Petavius would have it. And if it did, this〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉would be either in the fifth year of Xerxes, or three or four years after the twelfth, and therefore uncompliable with Petavius his deſign. How incredible it is, that Ezra's and Nehemiah's Decree ſhould not be reckoned from the ſame Epocha of Artaxerxes his Reign. What a glorious atchievement it is to diſcover a twentieth of Artaxerxes's reigning alone, from whence, computing by Solar years, the Paſſion of Chriſt will fall into the midst of the laſt week.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. III. A juſt Encomium of Thomas Lydiat. His fixing the beginning of the real Reign of Artaxerxes in the ſecond year of the 77. Olympiad, with the conſequences thereof. The proof of the above-mentioned Epocha from the time of Themiſtocles flight into Aſia, which was in that year. That he got to the Perſian Court in a very ſhort time, proved out of Plutarch. Of the confounding of the Names of Xerxes and Artaxerxes. And that Themiſtocles came to the Perſian Court about the time of the Exitus of the one, and Succeſſion of the other.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. IV. That Themiſtocles in the ſecond year of the 77. Olympiad, came to Artaxerxes newly beginning to reign, proved out of Thucydides. As alſo from the Teſtimony of Charon Lampſacenus. And the Suffrage of Plutarch. As likewiſe of Cornelius Nepos. To which is added the Judgment of that modern Hiſtorian Johannes Sleidanus. Why Plutarch preferred the Testimonies of Charon and Thucydides before thoſe of Ephorus, Dinon, Cleitarchus, Heraclides, and others. The Characters of them. A probable way of ſalving all their Credits, and that they do not claſh with the Teſtimony of Charon and Thucydides, at leaſt in any thing conſiderable.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. V. What is to be anſwered to the Teſtimony of Diodorus Siculus, that makes Xerxes live five or ſix years after his Conference with Themiſtocles. How Diodorus came to be wheedled into this miſtake. Cteſias Cnidius his Authority to be preferred before Herodotus touching the term of years that Darius Hyſtaſpis reigned.〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉for〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉in Hecataeus Mileſius writ through the oſcitancy of the Scribe; Or five years added to the Reign of Darius Hyſtaſpis wittingly by Herodotus to exerciſe his wit and invention thereon to pleaſe the Reader. A further weight added to the Authority of Cteſias Cnidius in this point from the ſecond Poſtulatum.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. VI. A paſſage in the Proem of Thucydides compared with Cteſias to prove, that Darius dyed after the Pugna Marathonia. The Suffrage of Georgius Syncellus to the ſame purpoſe. The ſame thing proved out of the Chronicon Marmoreum Arundelianum. The Authentickneſs and genuineneſs of Themiſtocles his Epiſtle to Polygnotus. It is clear out of this Epiſtle, that Themiſtocles his flight was near the contermination of Xerxes his Death, and Artxerxes ſucceeding him. Themiſtocles's ſpeed to the Perſian Court ſo ſoon as he got into Aſia. A paſſage or two in the aboveſaid Epiſtle that clearly demonſtrate, that it was Artaxerxes that Themiſtocles conferred with, his Father Xerxes being dead. The ample conſent of Teſtimonies to this Truth.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. VII. An Anſwer to a notable Objection fetched out of Ptolemy's Canon. Of the Authority and Antiquity of that Canon. That it is look't upon as conſiderable by all Chronologers: But ſo, as that both Scaliger and Petavius acknowledge an uncertainty and diſputableneſs in ſome particular Kings Reigns, though the ſumm of years from Nabonaſſar to the Death of Alexander, is of all hands held to be right. That careleſs Tranſcribers, or partial Correctors of the Canon, in favour of Herodotus, or of the Canon it ſelf, may have added faults thereunto. Ptolemy not concerned in thoſe Miſcorrections, they not happening in the years the Eclipſes are ſet down in, which reach but to the 31 of Darius Primus. The other Eclipſes noted are affixed to the Archons of Athens. The Royal Records of the Perſian Kings, which Cteſias had the uſe of, preferable to Ptolemy's Canon in the preſent Controverſie. That Ptolemy, notwithſtanding his skill in Aſtronomy, might after Herodotus be involved in that vulgar Errour touching the years of Darius Primus his Reign. The Application of the ſecond Poſtulatum to the caſe. The intricateneſs of Records that concern the right Epocha of Daniel's Weeks, how conſiſtent with Providence.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. VIII. The neceſsary Conſequences from the diſcovery of the right year of the beginning of Artaxerxes his Reign, viz. the ſecond year of the 77. Olympiad. (1) That the twentieth which is the firſt year of the 82. Olympiad, is the true Epocha of Daniel's Weeks. (2) That the Weeks end in the ſecond year of Caligula's Reign. (3) That Chriſt ſuffered in the twenty ſecond year of Tiberius. (4) That his Manifeſtation as the Meſſias was in the nineteenth of Tiberius. (5) That he was born L. Aelius Lamia and M. Servilius Geminus being Conſuls. Theſe four laſt point, to be proved ordine retrogrado by Hiſtory and Reaſon. That there is no more violence done byTho. Lydiat's placing the Nativity of Chriſt two years later than the Dionyſian account, than by Scaliger's placing it two years ſooner, nor ſo much as by Suſlyga and Kepler's placing it four or five years ſooner than Dionyſius.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. IX. That Christ was born four years before the death of Herod, according to Epiphanius and Sulpitius Severus. That Herod dyed, Metellus and Nerva being Conſuls, proved out of Joſephus, which is juſt four years after the Conſulſhip of Lamia and Geminus. That it is moſt certain that Herod was but betwixt fifteen and ſixteen years of Age when he was made Prefect of Galilee, and ridiculous to think that [〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉.] was writ for [〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉.] by the negligence of the Scribe. A full Anſwer to the paſſage of Joſephus. A difficult knot not otherwiſe to be untyed, than by ſuppoſing two Epocha's of Herod's Reign, the latter when
he was reſtored to his forfeited Kingdom by Auguſtus. The fitneſs and neceſſity of this ſolution, a further Argument that Herod dyed in the Conſulſhip of Metellus and Nerva. Reaſons to prove this latter Epocha. And that it was his chief Epocha, and moſt affected by Herod. That Euſebius makes uſe of this Epocha. And alſo Epiphanius, as likewiſe the ancient Graeci Faſti. That computing from this Epocha, Herod's 37 years Reign reaches to Nerva and Metellus, and that conſequently Chriſt's Birth is in the Conſulſhip of Lamia and Geminus.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. X. That Herod dyed in the Conſulſhip of Nerva and Metellus, proved from the time of Archelaus his Marriage of Glaphyra. From Dion Caſſius his placing Herod's Sons impleading one another before Auguſtus in the Conſulſhip of Lepidus and Aruntius. From Quirinius his confiſcating Archelaus his Goods, Statilius Taurus and Scribonius Libo being Conſuls. A groſs Parepochiſm committed by Joſephus. From Philip the Tetrarchs dying, Proculus and Nigrinus being Conſuls. From Euſebius and Sulpicius's allotting twenty four years to Herod the Tetrarch after the Relegation of Archelaus, and thoſe twenty four years ending with the fourth of Caius Caligula. From that famous Eclipſe of the Moon preceding Herod's death. A Narrative of Herod's Affairs correſponding with that Eclipſe. That there was ſuch an huge Eclipſe about a month before Herod's Death, in the Conſulſhip of Nerva and Metellus, T. L. makes good by Aſtronomical Calculation. The ſame Eclipſe calculated over again by the Ptolemaick, Alphonſine and Copernican Tables in N. Mulerius, and found rather bigger than what T. L. declares it. The groſs abſurdity of making the ſeventh of Artaxerxes the Epocha of Daniel's Weeks, it implying that Chriſt was baptized by John, before the Baptiſt enired on his Miniſtry. Lydiat's Eclipſe compared with Petavius's; as alſo with the Eclipſes of the 4711, 4712, and 4713 years of the I. P. And more particularly with that laſt, and the
ineptneſs thereof diſcovered. And therefore Herod dying in the year of Lydiat's Eclipſe, Chriſt muſt be born, Lamia and Geminus being Conſuls.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XI. Joſephus his inconſiſteney with himſelf in matters of Chronologie. The firſt Objection taken out of paſſages in him againſt Herod's dying Metellus and Nerva being Conſuls, that plainly imply that he reigned but thirty ſeven years in all, and that from his firſt being made King by the favour of M. Antony. The ſecond Objection from Antipater 's ſending his Children to the King of Arabia, when he began his War with Ariſtobulus: which was in the firſt year of the 178. Olympiad. Whence Herod is concluded twenty five years old when he was made Prefect of Galilee. In order to an Anſwer, two aſſured parcels of Joſephus his Materia Hiſtorica are premiſed. The firſt, that Herod was but fifteen years old when he was made Prefect of Galilee, ſeveral other paſſages in Joſephus complying therewith. The ſecond, that he was about ſeventy years of Age, and had reigned but thirty ſeven when he dyed. No occaſion for Joſephus to miſtake in the former parcel, but a very obvious one in the latter. That none of the five Children mentioned in the ſecond Objection, were thoſe ſent to the King of Arabia. That it is a contradiction to what Joſephus elſewhere ſays of Phaſaelus and Herod. If Joſephus meant thoſe five, that it is upon his having committed a Parepochiſm, to which his ſecond Hiſtorical Parcel lay obnoxious. Whence his Teſtimony to his firſt parcel preponderates that to the ſecond, and its repugnancy with the time of Chriſt's Baptiſm and trueEpocha of Daniel's Weeks, demonſtrates him to have miſſed the right Epocha of Herod's Reign: which with eaſe reconciles all theſe claſhings.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XII. The ſecond way of proving Chriſt born in the Conſulate of Lamia and Geminus, viz. from the Tax mentioned by S. Luke. Three general Taxes ordered by Auguſtus. The Text in S. Luke touching this Tax explained, and the Tax found the firſt of thoſe two which were carried on by Cyrenius. That this Tax is that mentioned in Suetonius and the Monumentum Ancyranum, viz. the middle Tax, and finiſhed in the Conſulate of Aelius Catus and Sextius Saturninus according to T. L. the year after that of Lamia and Geminus. That Chriſt was born Lamia and Geminus being Conſuls, proved from Auguſtus his Decennial Reſumptions of his Power Cenſorian and Monarchical. And alſo from the Time-eaten Monument of Ancyra. From the teſtimony of Clemens Alexandrinus placing the Birth of our Lord in the twenty eighth year when the Decree for the Tax
firſt went out after Octavius had the Name of Auguſtus conferred upon him. Five ſeveral Epocha's of Auguſtus his Reign, any whereof directing in compute to that time of Chriſt's Nativity that is pointed at by the true Epocha of Daniel's Weeks, is argumentative and confirms the ſame. That Epiphanius his twenty nine years from the perfect accord and ſubjection of the Jews to the Romans, reach into the Conſulate of Vinicius and Alfinius. The great advantage the twentieth of Artaxerxes has above the ſeventh, there being no ſenſe of this latter to be made from any Epocha's. Chriſt born in the forty firſt year of Auguſtus according to Irenaeus, Tertullian and other Fathers, which from a right Epocha reaches unto the Conſulate of Lamia and Geminus. A clear proof that Chriſt was then born, out of Euſebius his Chronicon. An Argument offered at by T. L. from a paſſage in Chryſoſtom's Homily De Natali Johannis Baptiſtae.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XIII. That Christ was born in the Conſulate of Lamia and Geminus, proved from the aboveſaid middle Tax of Auguſtus at carried on by Cyrenius in his first Preſidency 〈◊〉 Syria. A Parepochiſm committed by Joſeph••〈◊〉 this matter. A Chronological diſpoſure of certain years for the more aſſured finding out the true time of Cyrenius his being firſt Preſident of Syria, and carrying on Auguſtus his middle Tax. A brief Deſcant thereon. The time of Caius his going into the Eaſt, the main point to guide us to the firſt Preſidency of Cyrenius and the Nativity of Chriſt. Proved by many Arguments that Auguſtus ſent not Caius into the Eaſt before his thirteenth Conſulate. Cyrenius appointed Tutor to Caius upon Lollius his death, Vinicius and Alfinius being Conſuls, and upon Caius being unhappily wounded, becomes Governour of Syria that year, which therefore is his firſt Preſidency over Syria, and the beginning of his firſt Tax when Auguſtus alſo renewed his Cenſorian Power in quartum Decennium. This Tax continuing from Vinicius and Alfinius to the Conſulſhip of Catus Aelius and Sentius Saturninus. How naturally Chriſt's Birth is cast into the Conſulate betwixt, it agreeing alſo ſo punctually with the true Epocha of Daniel's Weeks. That the Temple of Janus was the third time ſhut, and Auguſtus refuſed the Title of Dominus (Characters of Chriſt's Nativity in Oroſius) Lamia and Geminus being Conſuls.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XIV. Two Objections out of Joſephus that would prove that Caius took not his Expedition into the Eaſt till after Herod was dead. (1.) Becauſe Joſephus mentions no Civilities done by Herod to Caius as he paſſed Judaea. (2.) Joſephus expreſly ſays, that Caius was at that Council that was called at Rome touching the diſpoſing of Herod's Kingdom upon his deceaſe. The Defectuouſneſs, Remiſneſs and Careleſneſs of Joſephus in ſeveral things, noted by Tho. Lydiat and others. His groſs miſtake in the time of the Commiſſion granted to Nehemiah noted by the Author. That he cannot be excuſed from the diſtance of Time or remoteneſs of Country. An Anſwer to the firſt Objection. Whether it was ignorance or diſſimulation in Joſephus that he writes nothing of Caius his Expedition into the Eaſt. Herod's Policy in forecaſting his journey to Rome, while Caius went into the East. An Anſwer to the ſecond Objection, that ſuppoſing there was any Son of Auguſtus at the above-mentioned Council, Joſephus has committed a Miſnomer, and ſet down Caius for Agrippa Poſthumus. Several Allegations out of Hiſtorians, that it could not be Agrippa that Auguſtus ſo honoured in that Council. Paſſages out of Tacitus and Dion that imply that it might be he. That if Joſephus did really mean Caius, he muſt do it on a ground wherein he groſly contradicts himſelf, and wherein he was more obnoxious to Errour, than in the other part of the Contradiction. That this ſtory
of Caius his Precedence in the above-named Council is no raſh fiction of Joſephus, but handſomly furmiſed upon his committing that notable Parepochiſm touching Herod's Reign.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XV. That Chriſt was baptized the nineteenth of Tiberius, proved from the Prophecy of Daniel from the year of Chriſt's Nativity and his Age when baptized. Nothing in S. Luke repugnant to Chriſt's being baptized in the fourth year of the Baptiſt's Miniſtry, with the childiſhneſs of their phancy that pretend to the contrary. The genuine ſenſe of that expreſſion of S. Paul [As John had fulfilled his courſe.] Four Arguments couched together for the proving Christ was baptized the nineteenth of Tiberius. Hiſtorical paſſages which comport with the Baptiſt's four years Miniſtry: As that of the Jews ſaying to Chriſt, Forty ſix years was this Temple in building, &c. John not beheaded till Vitellius was Prefect of Syria (which was in the twenty first of Tiberius, about two years after he had baptized Chriſt. That the ſlaughter of the Galileans or Samaritans by Pilate was in the last year of his own Prefecture, and Tiberius his Reign, while Christ was alive.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XVI. What Arguments prove Chriſt crucified the twenty ſecond of Tiberius, prove him baptized the nineteenth; and the Miniſtry of John to have continued four years before. That Chriſt ſuffered the twenty ſecond of Tiberius proved out of Epiphanius: As alſo from what is ſaid Joh. 11.49. That Caiaphas was High-Prieſt that year. And likewiſe from Pilate's not acquainting Tiberius with the News of Chriſt's Reſurrection till the twenty ſecond of his Reign. The Baptiſm of Chriſt in the nineteenth of Tiberius proved from the troubles that fell upon the Jews in the third of Caius Caligula. From the Tradition of Apollonius, that Chriſt charged the Apoſtles not to preach the Goſpel to the Gentiles till twelve years after the commencement thereof. From Paul's journeying from Antioch to Jeruſalem when Herod King of Chalcis dyed. The miſtake of Euſebius and ſome others that confound the ſtory of Herod in the Acts with that of Agrippa in Joſephus. From there being fourteen years ſince Paul's Converſion in the eleventh of Claudius. From Paul's departing from Athens to Corinth, being not till after the twelfth of Claudius. From the time of Gallio's being Deputy of Achaia, which could not be till after Claudius his death. From the ten years of Felix his Preſiding over Judaea. From Peter's ſuffering Martyrdom
in the eleventh year of Nero, when he had been poſſeſſed of the Sacerdotal Chair twenty five years from the expiration of the twelve years reſtraint of the Apoſtles from preaching to the Gentiles. A further Confirmation thereof out of the Chronicle of Marcellinus Comes. The Unjuſtneſs of that Imputation, that T. L. his account of the Epocha of Daniel's Weeks, is a Fiction deſtitute of Hiſtory.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XVII. A Tripartition of a Letter to a Friend touching the firſt Reſurrection and the Calling of the Jews. The firſt part thereof. What Expoſition the moſt eaſie and natural. That the primitive Fathers following this Rule expounded the firſt Reſurrection in a Phyſical ſenſe, not Political. That Grotius alſo expounds it ſo, but in what deficient. An Objection from two places of Scripture [Luke 14.14.] and [2 Tim. 4.8.] An Anſwer to the firſt. Who as well as Martrys capable of the firſt Reſurrection? An Anſwer to the ſecond. What meant by the Day of Chriſt's appearing. That it may be the time of his Millennial Kingdom. That the Martyrs receive their reward in the Morning of that day. Others at the Evening thereof.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XVIII. The ſecond part of the Letter, touching the Calling of the Jews. Whether they be not to be converted by ſome Miraculous way, ſuppoſe by a Voice or Viſion from Heaven. Whether that of Zachary (Chap. 12. v. 10.) import ſo much. That the words of our Saviour (Matt. 23. v. 39.) ſeem to imply ſome ſuch thing: As alſo that of S. Paul (1 Tim. 1.16.) The probability of the way of the Jews Converſion from theſe three places of Scripture.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XIX. The laſt part of the Letter. The Reinforcement of his Objection againſt the literal or phyſical ſenſe of the firſt Reſurrection, from two parallel places of Daniel and John. An Anſwer to that Reinforcement from thoſe very parallel places. The Genius of the Prophetick Stile in Daniel and John, in intimating one Antitheton by another. What Antitheton to [thoſe awakened into Eternal life] in Daniel is to be found in the Apocalypſe. What is meant by the Devil's detruſion into the Abyſs. That the firſt Reſurrection is Phyſical, not Political, proved from the Text it ſelf, Apoc. 20. v. 4. That the Judgment there did paſs upon thoſe that were either naturally or politically dead before the Millennium, when the wicked were not politically ſo, and therefore cannot be thoſe revived (in a Political ſenſe) after the Millennium. Further Arguments that the firſt Reſurrection is Phyſical.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XX. That the Deſcription of the New Jeruſalem is a Deſcription of a ſtate of the Church on Earth. The high expreſſions therein, but ſuch as are uſed in the Prophets touching the people of the Jews. The Plea of thoſe that will have it merely a Deſcription of the Church Triumphant in Heaven, conſiſting of ſeven Arguments out of Alcazar. An Anſwer to thoſe ſeven Arguments. A more moderate way betwixt them that hold the Deſcription of the New Jeruſalem, the one, to ſignifie merely ſuch a ſtate of the Church on Earth, the other the ſtate of the Church in Heaven, viz. That though it be a Prophecy of an excellent ſtate of the Church on Earth, yet the Deſcription of that ſtate is an intended Type alſo of the ſtate of the Church Triumphant in Heaven.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XXI. The occaſion of his more fully making out that grand Truth, that the whole Apocalypſe in a manner conſiſts of three main Prophecies, beginning with the Church, and reaching to the end of the World, viz. the Epiſtolar Prophecy, Sealed Book-Prophecy, and Opened Book-Prophecy, with the three Introductory Viſions prefixed thereto. That the Epiſtolar Prophecy is ſuch a Prophecy. That the Sealed Book-Prophecy is ſuch. And alſo the Opened Book-Prophecy. The Reference of the three Introductory Viſions to the Title of the Book of the Apocalypſe. Introductory Viſions to Prophecies in Iſaiah, Ezekiel and Daniel, and that they are not properly Prophecies themſelves. The Meaning of the Introductory Viſion of the Epiſtolar Prophecy. The like Meaning of the Introductory Viſion to the Prophecy of the Sealed Book. The drift of the third Introductory Viſion, muchwhat the ſame with the two former, and that the Angel there appearing, is Chriſt. That this third Introductory Viſion is a
kind of Tranſitionary Introduction to the Opened Book-Prophecy. Proved briefly from the Oath of the Angel, that the Sealed Book-Prophecy reaches to the End of the World.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XXII. A Mechanical frame of the Seven-ſealed Book, ſo contrived, as is requiſite for no more Writing than what belongs to the preſent Seal, to be ſeen at once. The different Opinions of Interpreters what this Book ſignifies. The miſtake of the Ancients in conceiving it to be the Bible. What this Book really is the Symbol of. That this Book its being ſaid to be written within and without, denotes a twofold ſenſe, that of the Symbolical Letter, and that of the inward Prophetical meaning of thoſe Symbols. Arguments to prove this to be the right ſenſe of being writ within and without. Ezekiel's Roll writ within and without, compared with this Seven-ſealed Book of the Apocalypſe. Three uſeful Conſectaries deduced therefrom.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XXIII. His reaſon of inſerting here his Demonſtration, that the Reformation begun by Luther is the Riſing of the Witneſſes. The two firſt Viſions of the Opened Book-Prophecy proved Synchronal. The agreement of the fore-parts of theſe two Viſions, and the exquiſite correſpondency of the middle-parts one with another. Whence the Fall of Babylon in the ſecond Viſion is proved to be the ſame with the Fall of the City and Riſing of the Witneſſes in the firſt. That conſequently the Fall of Babylon in the ſecond Viſion is after the ſixth Trumpet. That the Fall of Babylon and Riſing of the Witneſſes is the Object of thoſe Acclamations in Heaven, Chap. 11. and of the Doxology of the Elders. As alſo of the Song of Moſes and the Lamb ſung by the Victors over the Beaſt. That this Song therefore follows the ſixth Trumpet. And that all the Viols follow that Song. From whence the above-mentioned Demonſtration is concluded.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XXV. Nine Queries with Notes thereon to a Friend, leading to undeniable aſſurance, that not a Prophetical Day nor Month but a Semi-time is the Unite for the computing the Time of the Event in the Medial Viſions.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XXVI. Whether the forty two months Reign of the Beaſt commence with the Apoſtaſie, or begin fifty or ſixty years after, out of an Anſwer to a Letter from a worthy Friend. Three Arguments to prove it did not commence with the Apoſtaſie. Several things premiſed in order to an Anſwer to thoſe Arguments. An Anſwer to the firſt and ſecond Arguments. An Anſwer to the third. Hints of an Anſwer to other Particulars in the aboveſaid Letter. Of the Author's twofold Riſing of the Witneſſes, Speciminal and Gradual. And who are properly to be accounted Witneſſes. In what ſenſe the Author ſays they were riſen above thirty years ago. Daniel's Semi-times how illuſtrated by the Apocalypſe. What the forty two months Reign of the Beaſt. The Extenſion of Time in the Witneſſes Riſing not to be eluded by the comparing it to the felling of a Tree at the laſt ſtroke. In what ſenſe the Author makes the Days of the Witneſſes expire Anno 1652. What is the fulleſt and largeſt ſenſe of the Witneſſes Political Death.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XXVII. Hints of an Anſwer to a ſecond Letter from the ſame Hand. A Semi-time the Unite in computing the Events of the Medial Viſions proved by the Author. Not four hundred thirty two, but three hundred ninety three, the Author's Epocha for the Medial Viſions. The odd Semi-time in Daniel added to good purpoſe. The prevailing of the little Horn, Dan. 7. how to be underſtood. The meaning of [After three days and an half]. His Friend's miſtake touching the ſecond Query. His uſe of a Prophetick Henopoeia in Anſwer to the ſixth Query, but no avoiding thereby but that Luther's Reformation will be the final Iſſue of the forty two months War, and a Semi-time the Unite for computing the Medial Viſions.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XXVIII. Hints of an Anſwer to a third Letter. Further Victories againſt Antichriſt after the Reformation not to be called any Riſing of the Witneſſes. Who Competitors for being the ſeventh Head or eighth King. An Hierarchical Pagano-Chriſtian Head, how eaſily conceived to precede in order of Nature before the Caeſarean, and that it was as ſoon as the Apoſtaſie came in. That the Author affirms not that the Caeſars continued purely Chriſtian an hundred and twenty years. That the Chriſtian Caeſars complied with the Apoſtaſie of the Church from the beginning amply made out by Reaſon and Hiſtory. In what ſenſe the forty two months War of the Beaſt may be ſaid to commence as early as the Apoſtaſie. The Beaſt is in being before the ten Kings, the Empire ipſo facto becoming a Beaſt by the Apoſtaſie, which commenced before they were riſen. That〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 Apoc. 13.5. does not ſignifie to continue at large, not ſuppoſed by the Author, but proved by him.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XXIX. Hints of an Anſwer to a fourth Letter. That the Riſing of the Witneſſes, Rev. 11. denotes a partial Regaining only of the Kingdom of Antichriſt into the hands of Chriſt. A further Enforcement of the ſame Truth. The Event of the forty two months War of the Beaſt in what ſenſe partial, in what final. The whole Event of the Riſing of the Witneſſes the Object of the Prediction. The Times and Half reach not beyond the ſixth Trumpet. The Object and Subject of the three Wo-Trumpets not the ſame. The continued Conflict betwixt the Antichriſtian and Evangelical Party with the Effects thereof to what Viſions referrable. Paſſages in Daniel, Chap. 7. amply explained. That even from our Antagoniſts Epocha the Reckoning not by Years but Semi-times in the Medial Viſions is neceſſary. No hopes of foretelling from the Medial Numbers to a year or thereabout, when the Church's Affliction ſhall ceaſe, proved by many Arguments. The danger of forcing out pleaſing Interpretations of the Prophetical Viſions when they will not afford them.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XXX. Two Arguments out of a fifth Letter from the ſame hand to prove, That the Roman Beaſt under the ſeventh Head was not in being till the ten Kings ſignified by the ten Horns were riſen up in the Empire. Certain things premiſed in order to an Anſwer to the ſaid Arguments. Amongst which is the true Notion of the Head of a Beaſt in the Prophetick Stile, in counterdiſtinction to his Horns. An Enumeration of the Heads of the Beaſt, and what the fulleſt ſenſe of the ſeventh Head. An Anſwer to the firſt Argument. An Anſwer to the ſecond Argument. Two Arguments of the Author's to prove, that the Roman Beaſt under the ſeventh Head was in being before the ten Kings ſignified by the ten Horns were riſen up in the Empire. That the placing the Epocha of the forty two months War of the Beaſt in the beginning of the Apoſtaſie is unexceptionably right, with the groſs abſurdities of the other Opinion.

      * The firſt Poſtulatum.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

Another ſquare Area equal to the former belonging to the Inner Court, and placed in the midst of the former, with Inferences therefrom. A full Weſt ſquare Area equal to the former, meaſured by the Angel, with Villalpandus his deſcant thereon. How from theſe five equal ſquare Area's in form of a Croſs, and from the diſcovery of a North-Weſt ſquare Area, Villalpandus collects the whole Edifice of the Temple to be both ſquare, and alſo to have nine equal ſquare Area's appertaining thereto. Another way of proving the Squareneſs of the whole Houſe of God or Temple. A Deſcription of the North-Weſt Court out of Ezekiel, with Villalpandus his deſcant thereon. A Confirmation of Villalpandus his dimenſions of the Courts of the Temple from the Heathen Oracle recorded in S. Auſtin. The Pagan Daemons not unskilled in Mathematicks, proved from Apollo's bidding the Greeks double his Altar in Delos.

      * The ſecond Poſtulatum.

    _ CHAP. XXXV. Three Objections from a conſiderate hand. The first againſt our making the three Times and an Half, the forty two months and twelve hundred and ſixty days to be the ſame time. The ſecond, againſt oun affirming the Euphratean Horſemen to have ſubdued the Eaſtern Roman Empire with Fire-Guns.

An Examination of this Hypotheſis, That it
fails in the placing the Epocha of the 2300 Evening-Mornings. The firſt Collateral Line of ſeventy five years examined. The Examination of the ſecond Collateral Line or ſeventy Weeks of Daniel. Of the third Collateral Line four hundred and four years, and the marvellous Invention thereof.

The right Epocha of the 2300 Evening-Mornings and of Daniel's 1290 and 1335 days is to be fixt in Antiochus his Pollution of the Sanctuary. No hopes from the Compute of Daniel's 2300 Evening-Mornings, of the Papacy and Turkiſh Tyranny being broken within twelve years, &c.
